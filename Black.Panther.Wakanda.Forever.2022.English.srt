00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,158
But, as always, Okoye had notes.

309
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,492
What were her notes?

310
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,952
She hates them.

311
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,036
Oh.

312
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,668
What about recreating
the Heart-Shaped Herb?

313
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,962
Have you made any progress on that?

We do not need the Herb, Mother.

321
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,395
We need new technology.

322
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,730
What of the Black Panther?

323
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,612
The mantle has unified
our nation for centuries.

324
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,864
The Black Panther
is a relic, Mother.

325
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,450
I wasn't trying to save
the mantle with the Herb,

326
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,702

Have you planned anything?

337
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:55,250
Yes. It involves you taking
your mother for a drive.

- Right now?
- Right now.

339

- No, no.

350

from the wound caused
by T'Challa's death.

351
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,465
I'm fine, Mother.

352
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,844
You don't have to worry about me.

353
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:52,724

but that doesn't mean he is gone.

356

When that illness
took your brother from us,

357
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:05,653
I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.

358

But I still took time in the bush.

359
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,951
I wandered until I found water.

360
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,494
And I sat.

361
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,789
Then I did this ritual

362
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,334
that I am about to show you now.

pushing me gently, but firm.

366
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,973
Like his hand on my shoulder.

It took some time,

00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,147
but he was there.

369
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:48,780
He wasn't there, Mother.

370
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,033
The presence that you felt

371
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,035
was just a construct of your mind.

378
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,933

detected vibranium

I was able to
stop them from minin' it,

426
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:04,851
but we need Wakanda's help

Your son exposed the power
of vibranium to the world.

433
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,998
In response,
other nations have begun

434
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,499

436
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,256
I think Wakanda
could find the scientist

437
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,632
and bring them to me?

438
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:41,387

helps to resolve our dilemma.

So he can kill them?

481
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,689
Do it.

482
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,776
We never had to face an enemy

483
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,611

484
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:05,573

that vibranium exists
outside of Wakanda.

Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.

Our planet is covered
of mostly water,

510
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:13,682
so it's reasonable

511
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,810
that the other one
just landed there.

512
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,062

God, look, the way that

is that I give you information

we cannot tell you.

to come to Talokan.

1284
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:07,540
Please take this as a token
of our gratitude.

1285
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:17,300
It was made with the plant
that saved Talokan.

1286
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,471
You are young, Princess.

1287
01:17:22,347 --> 01:17:25,266
When you age as I do, you realize

1288
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:28,186
we all lose everyone we love.

1289
01:17:28,353 --> 01:17:29,938
But when I lost my brother,

1290
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:31,731
it just felt different.

1291
01:17:31,898 --> 01:17:33,566
He suffered in silence.

1292
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:37,153
When he finally asked me
to help him, I couldn't.

1293
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:39,948
How does that make sense

1294
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:44,577
that the ancestors would
give me gifts and skills

1295
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:47,497
to help me save my brother,
and I couldn't?

1296
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:49,999
Why?

1297
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,963
I don't have an answer
for that question.

1298
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,634
My ancestors would often say,

1299
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:03,429
"Only the most broken people
can be great leaders."

1300
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,352
I admire what you have built here.

1301
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:14,107
And how you've protected
your people.

1302
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,944
But as princess of Wakanda,

1303
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,572
I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.

1304
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:25,368
My nation will not rest
until I'm returned.

1305
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:28,913
I'm not leaving without her.

1306
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:33,376
We need to find a peaceful way
to resolve this.

1307
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:38,756
It is no longer about the scientist.

1308
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:42,468
For centuries, the surface nations

1309
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:45,346
have conquered and enslaved
people like us.

1310
01:18:46,014 --> 01:18:47,473
Over resources.

1311
01:18:48,892 --> 01:18:51,144
Since the day I buried my mother,

1312
01:18:51,311 --> 01:18:52,937
I have prepared my people

1313
01:18:53,021 --> 01:18:55,148
for the time they will come for us.

1314
01:18:55,315 --> 01:18:59,527
And that machine is the sign
that the time is now.

1315
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:06,743
I need to know if Wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.

1316
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,037
There is no in-between.

1317
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:14,876
So you plan to wage war
on the entire world,

1318
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,795
and you want Wakanda to help you?

1319
01:19:18,713 --> 01:19:19,881
That's madness.

1320
01:19:20,048 --> 01:19:23,051
There isn't a nation
that wouldn't plunder Wakanda

1321
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:24,677
if given a chance.

1322
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:27,931
If we make an alliance,

1323
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,808
we can protect each other
by striking them first.

1324
01:19:31,351 --> 01:19:35,605
Then, when the threat of these
nations has been eliminated,

1325
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:38,399
the scientist will be returned
to Wakanda.

1326
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:41,611
And if Wakanda
does not accept, what then?

1327
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,656
The scientist will die.

1328
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:48,576
And Wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

1329
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:50,370
An attack on my people?

1330
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,163
Yes.

1331
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:54,707
And I want you to listen to me.

1332
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:57,835
Wakanda cannot win a war
with Talokan.

as part of their outreach program.

1383

01:46:54,784 --> 01:46:55,785
The women that were guarding us,

1732
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:56,869
they had water over their mouths

1733
01:46:56,953 --> 01:46:58,663
and on their necks.

1734
01:46:58,746 --> 01:46:59,747
He didn't have that.

1735
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:02,333
Several organisms don't need gills

1736
01:47:02,417 --> 01:47:05,336
to extract oxygen
from the water, so...

1737
01:47:05,503 --> 01:47:07,046
It's like a jellyfish.

1738
01:47:07,213 --> 01:47:11,009
He just absorbs the oxygen
from his skin.

1739
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:13,344
It's a process called

1740
01:47:13,428 --> 01:47:14,637
- Diffusion.

Every day that passes

1750

is a day wasted.

1751
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:45,043
We must deal with Namor

1752
01:47:45,126 --> 01:47:46,878
before he brings
his warriors back here.

1753
01:47:47,045 --> 01:47:49,714
And how are we to deal with
a man with that much power?

1754
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:52,383
In that attack,
before he took out your plane,

1755
01:47:52,467 --> 01:47:53,718
he jumped back into the water.

1756
01:47:53,885 --> 01:47:55,637
What if that's what
makes him strong?

1757
01:47:55,803 --> 01:47:57,722
He's breathing air
and getting oxygen

1758
01:47:57,805 --> 01:47:59,349
from the water on his skin.

1759
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:01,559
If we could find a way
to dry his ass out,

1760
01:48:01,643 --> 01:48:02,769
he won't be as strong.

1761
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:04,354
Yo, that's it.

1762
01:48:04,437 --> 01:48:07,649
Griot. We need to convert
the Royal Talon Fighter

1763
01:48:07,732 --> 01:48:09,275
into a pervaporation chamber.

1764

01:55:16,702 --> 01:55:18,245
what was necessary
to change Wakanda.

1891
01:55:19,663 --> 01:55:21,165
How many people like your scientist

1892
01:55:21,248 --> 01:55:23,626
did Wakanda protect
before I took the throne?

1893
01:55:24,668 --> 01:55:25,669
Cowards.

1894
01:55:25,836 --> 01:55:28,089
That was the Panthers
that came before me,

1895
01:55:29,173 --> 01:55:30,174
and before T'Challa.

1896
01:55:30,257 --> 01:55:32,093
Don't mention my brother.

1897
01:55:32,426 --> 01:55:34,095
You're the reason why he's dead.

1898
01:55:34,595 --> 01:55:37,848
You burnt the Herb,
left us with no protector.

1899
01:55:38,015 --> 01:55:40,267
Then Namor struck
and killed my mother.

1900
01:55:40,434 --> 01:55:42,269
Their blood is on your hands.

1901
01:55:43,437 --> 01:55:44,772
That ain't on me.

1902
01:55:45,314 --> 01:55:46,690
And don't you dare

1903
01:55:46,857 --> 01:55:48,692
take that away from your mother.

1904
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,444
She sacrificed her life to protect

1905
01:55:50,528 --> 01:55:52,363
a young girl from the lost tribe.

1906
01:55:53,739 --> 01:55:56,408
Your father, he was a hypocrite.

1907
01:55:57,910 --> 01:55:59,662
He would've killed that girl.

1908
01:56:00,371 --> 01:56:02,289
Shit, he killed his own brother.

1909
01:56:03,874 --> 01:56:06,544
T'Challa was too noble.

1910
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:11,048
He let the man
who murdered your father live.

1911
01:56:13,175 --> 01:56:14,844
And here you stand.

1912
01:56:20,516 --> 01:56:22,643
Are you gonna be noble
like your brother

1913
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:24,895

This is my son, Toussaint.

this is your aunty, Shuri.

Hi.

2372
02:32:17,963 --> 02:32:20,632
We agreed it was better
for him to grow up here.

2373
02:32:20,799 --> 02:32:23,885
Away from the pressure
of the throne.

your <font color="#00FF7F"><i>baba,</i></font>

2376
02:32:29,016 --> 02:32:31,685
prepared us for his death,
didn't he?

2377
02:32:36,356 --> 02:32:38,400
But he didn't want us
to go to the funeral

2378
02:32:39,234 --> 02:32:42,154
because he felt the time
was not yet right.

2379
02:32:42,863 --> 02:32:45,657
So we had our own ceremony
for him here.

2380
02:32:47,409 --> 02:32:48,994
Did my mother meet him?
