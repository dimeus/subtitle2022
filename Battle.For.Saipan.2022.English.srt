1
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:54,486
So it will be

2
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,532
with the resurrection
of the dead.

3
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,450
The body that is sown
is perishable,

4
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,105
rises imperishable.

5
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,108
It is sown weak.

6
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:10,328
It is risen with power.

7
00:02:10,502 --> 00:02:15,290
It is sown in dishonor.
It is risen with glory.

8
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:20,121
It is sown as a natural body,
it is risen as a spiritual.

9
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:24,125
If there is a natural body,
there is a spiritual body.

10
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:27,650
That'’s why I love you, major.

11
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:29,452
Five klicks north,
we should find a second

12
00:02:29,476 --> 00:02:30,184
division hospital.

13
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:33,395
Heads up, they hydrated.
We ain'’t in London no more.

14
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,223
We got trees here,
so watch your six.

15
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:37,007
Copy that. Yes, Sir.

16
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:38,530
No more teatime, huh, Major?

17
00:02:38,704 --> 00:02:40,445
No more teatime, Private.

18
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,927
Just remember
this is a quick sweep.

19
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:45,581
Five, six days,

20
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:47,733
you could be home having
grits with grandma, Reynolds.

21
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:49,357
Oh,
my granny makes the best grits

22
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:50,151
in all of Texas.

23
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:51,563
Well, you go ahead and tell Nana

24
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,066
she got a new grandson
named Gustavo,

25
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,720
and I want some of them grits.

26
00:02:54,894 --> 00:02:56,133
I wouldn'’t care much
for your grandma'’s grits,

27
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:57,593
but I'’d love
to meet your sister.

28
00:02:57,767 --> 00:03:00,944
Hey, sonny boy,
you too young for that,

29
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:03,207
but maybe when
you'’re older, young gun.

30
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,372
Take cover! Watch your six!

31
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:48,312
Ammo!

32
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:32,269
You'’re a cold-blooded
killer, Sir.

33
00:05:32,443 --> 00:05:35,577
Let me look. You'’ve been
long-bladed, soldier.

34
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:37,143
Keep some pressure
on that, okay?

35
00:05:37,318 --> 00:05:39,015
All right, okay.Pressure.

36
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:40,843
All right. Let'’s see
what we'’ve got.

37
00:05:41,017 --> 00:05:43,389
Hey,
you make sure you call my mom.

38
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:44,803
She'’s gonna be mad.

39
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:47,153
She'’s gonna be real mad.

40
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:50,809
Pressure! Listen to me.

41
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,376
We gotta move, gotta go quietly.

42
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,590
Can you make it? Yes, sir.

43
00:05:53,638 --> 00:05:54,726
Up we go. On your feet.

44
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:28,200
Vic. Hey, you get any rest?

45
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:29,550
Nah.

46
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:32,248
You look like shit.Thanks.

47
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:34,513
Could try and get you
some diphenhydramine

48
00:09:34,537 --> 00:09:35,294
if you'’d like.

49
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:37,152
I used to use it to
get to sleep when

50
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,341
my mother-in-law visited.

51
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:40,212
Let'’s hope it doesn'’t
come to that.

52
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,824
Something else?

53
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:44,477
Saw something else in a crate.

54
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,612
Not sure it was supposed
to be in the supply boat.

55
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:47,916
Yeah, what? Bourbon.

56
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,223
No, no, no. I need
to keep my head clear.

57
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:54,096
Probably better. There'’s
no diphen out here anyway.

58
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,185
I hear we'’re both up
for double shifts today.

59
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:58,448
No, no. I heard we got
new personnel

60
00:09:58,622 --> 00:09:59,754
coming in from Hawaii.

61
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:01,582
That'’s what I heard too.

62
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:03,255
Looks like that'’s not
happening anymore.

63
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,977
This is bullshit. Talk to your friend.

64
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:08,371
Maybe I will.

65
00:10:18,642 --> 00:10:20,165
Password.

66
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:22,690
Come on, Jake, it'’s me.

67
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:25,780
Good luck, Vic.
General'’s in a bad mood.

68
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:28,521
Isn'’t he always? It'’s worse.

69
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,524
Worse? Just a warning.

70
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:34,484
Thanks for the tip.

71
00:10:37,226 --> 00:10:38,444
Password?

72
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:43,101
I haven'’t slept for days.

73
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,860
How am I supposed to remember

74
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:45,974
what the password is?

75
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:47,410
That'’s close enough.

76
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:55,505
Oh wow.

77
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:00,510
Now this makes me homesick.

78
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:06,342
Keeps a little
normalcy in my life

79
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:08,649
in the middle
of all this insanity.

80
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,134
Smoke?

81
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,397
Thanks. I quit.

82
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,860
It helps me with my headaches.

83
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:24,882
I think that'’s what
they call addiction.

84
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:26,623
What do they call this?

85
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:28,843
Bonus?

86
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,628
I'’ll drink to that.

87
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:36,633
What can I help you with, Vic?

88
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:40,506
I just heard that
we'’re not getting

89
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:43,771
new surgeons shipped in. I heard the same.

90
00:11:45,294 --> 00:11:47,795
That'’s a mistake.
We'’re being overrun

91
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:48,819
in here.

92
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:51,604
What do you want me
to do about it?

93
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:54,877
Plead our case. They'’re not gonna
listen to me.

94
00:11:54,956 --> 00:11:56,324
They put me out here
so they don'’t have to

95
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,741
listen to me anymore.

96
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,744
We'’re a week late
on the morphine.

97
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:03,704
Troops are our priority.

98
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:09,579
Yeah, I, I'’m not
getting any sleep.

99
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:11,189
I'’m not the only one.

100
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,845
Everyone'’s pulling
six shifts without a break.

101
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,804
It'’s been over a month, Jake.

102
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,243
How'’s your hand? Still shaking?

103
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:25,029
Not at the moment.

104
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,443
Well, you keep up this schedule,

105
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:27,355
don'’t get enough sleep,

106
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,391
it'’s gonna get worse
and you'’re not gonna be

107
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,078
any good to us

108
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:31,572
as a surgeon,
let alone a soldier,

109
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:32,994
if you have to pick up a weapon.

110
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,563
Luckily, as a surgeon,
we don'’t have to

111
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:39,348
arm ourselves during battle.

112
00:12:44,005 --> 00:12:45,049
Vic,

113
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:47,573
I'’ll do what I can.

114
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:49,750
Thanks, Jake.Yeah.

115
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,798
You really should start
easing up on that.

116
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,656
I'’m getting ready so
I can toast to Jesus

117
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,716
when my time comes.

118
00:13:00,935 --> 00:13:02,763
Isn'’t that supposed
to be with wine?

119
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:05,026
Who'’s keeping track?

120
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:07,855
Vic,

121
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:13,251
you'’ll be home soon.

122
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,913
I wish I could say the same.

123
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:37,667
Secure the patient!
Prepare for surgery.

124
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:40,061
Roll him in.
Prepare for surgery.

125
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:41,690
Secure the patient,
secure the patient.

126
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:44,369
Hold his legs down.
Stay still, Kid.

127
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:47,600
Oh my god! Oh my god! My arm!

128
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:49,940
I'’m gonna lose my arm!

129
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:53,814
Just breathe!
Stay with me, stay with me.

130
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:55,828
I'’m gonna lose my arm,
I'’m gonna lose my arm!

131
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:58,253
You'’re gonna be fine,
you'’re gonna be fine!

132
00:13:58,427 --> 00:14:00,274
The bastard jumped at me! What have you
got here?

133
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,866
Shrapnel to his forearm,
ripped it up pretty bad.

134
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,155
Given him more
than enough morphine

135
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:05,062
but he ain'’t taking to it.

136
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:07,088
The arm? It'’s hanging on
by a thread.

137
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:08,437
Needs to be amputated.

138
00:14:08,611 --> 00:14:11,614
What'’s your name,
Buster? Adell.

139
00:14:11,788 --> 00:14:13,659
Adell, is that your
first or last name?

140
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:15,879
First. Last name'’s Dollins.

141
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:18,142
Dollins? Where you from?

142
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,665
Paris, Texas.

143
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,451
I got a cousin from
Greensville. You ever been?

144
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:24,627
Yeah.

145
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:26,237
Hold him down. Secure the legs.

146
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:30,676
They'’ve got a great
burger joint. Am I right?

147
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:32,809
Yeah, they do. Yeah they do, they do,

148
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:36,508
they do, and those Texas girls?

149
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:38,989
I mean, the Southern
belle is all.

150
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:40,488
Mine'’s from Tennessee,
but you know,

151
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,166
you gotta get
one of those, right?

152
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,559
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:47,693
Southern girls down there.
Huh? Beautiful.

154
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:49,826
You did good kid, you did good.

155
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,568
You'’re okay. It'’s okay.

156
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:55,092
No, no, no. You'’re okay.
You'’re fine. Don'’t look.

157
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:57,138
My arm! My arm!

158
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,140
My arm! Get in, get in.
Get back in.

159
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:02,404
I play ball. What am I
gonna do with one arm?

160
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:04,667
Right, get him in a room
and get someone

161
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:06,681
to write a letter back
home for him, all right?

162
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:08,932
Guys, that'’s you too.
Let'’s go.

163
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:11,717
All right.
Let'’s cut a rug, sugar.

164
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:15,504
There we go, people.
There we go. Keep it moving.

165
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:45,926
God!

166
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,640
Private.

167
00:16:48,814 --> 00:16:51,469
Up you get. Up you get, soldier.

168
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:17,321
Come on, come on, come on!

169
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:20,716
Camila, he needs to get
to surgery, now.

170
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,290
We got a gaping
puncture wound here.

171
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,154
Probably a bayonet,
massive bleeding.

172
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:26,287
Well, you and your friend
are lucky to be alive.

173
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:28,637
You think? Major Porter,
Staten Island.

174
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:31,074
Gustavo Esposito, Los Angeles.

175
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:35,122
Vic Weber, Brooklyn.
Go, go, go, go!

176
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,526
Good work. Thank you.

177
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,094
Gave him some of my
grandfather'’s vodka.

178
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:53,140
You smuggling in booze,
young lady?

179
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:55,685
You haven'’t had this vodka yet,

180
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:56,491
have you?

181
00:17:56,665 --> 00:17:57,840
No.

182
00:18:00,277 --> 00:18:01,713
Oh, sorry.

183
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:03,498
You didn'’t wake me.

184
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:05,935
I can'’t sleep on this
god forsaken island.

185
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:07,676
Hey, do me a favor.

186
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,244
Go take care of somebody
worse off than me. I'’m fine.

187
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:11,419
You sure? Yeah.

188
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:19,688
Insomnia'’s a pretty common
problem around here.

189
00:18:19,862 --> 00:18:21,690
Where'’d you ship in from?

190
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:23,822
Great Britain.
Can'’t you tell by my accent?

191
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:25,563
I could tell you'’re
from the boroughs.

192
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,367
That'’s '’cause you'’re
from Brooklyn.Yeah.

193
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:28,751
But judging by your
lack of accent,

194
00:18:28,914 --> 00:18:30,699
you ain'’t been there
in a while.

195
00:18:32,222 --> 00:18:35,399
I went out to California,
graduated from UCLA.

196
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,401
That was my next question.

197
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:41,797
But hey, I did pick up
a little jolly old English

198
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:43,625
while I was
stationed over there,

199
00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:44,887
comes out when I'’m mad.

200
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:46,758
Yeah? I can'’t hear it.

201
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,152
You will.

202
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,328
How'’s Gustavo?

203
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:54,853
Another ten minutes,
he might not have

204
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:55,877
made it.

205
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,075
Leanne'’s got a good
bedside manner.

206
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:00,511
He stands a pretty good chance.

207
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:02,557
That'’s good.

208
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:08,258
Oh! Jesus! What do you give
for pain here, Doc, soda pop?

209
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:11,522
Easy, easy.
You lost a lot of blood.

210
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:14,177
They'’re a quarter inch
away from your kidneys.

211
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:15,707
Yeah.
Nice wound to match the one

212
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:16,788
on the other side, right?

213
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:18,746
I saw that. And a whole bunch

214
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,356
of others.

215
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,402
They tell a story, yeah?

216
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:22,664
Yeah. All from combat?

217
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:25,101
Hell no, Doc.

218
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:27,763
Street fights down at the
Plaza bar by Carrington Avenue.

219
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:28,787
You ain'’t been there?

220
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:30,062
Man. Never heard of it.

221
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:31,586
You don'’t get out

222
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,640
to the forgotten boroughs
too much, now, do you?

223
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:36,982
They have a minor league team
that isn'’t very good.

224
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,681
I forgot what they were called.

225
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,949
Staten Island Yankees.

226
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:50,648
A disgrace to their namesake.

227
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,415
Hey, wait. Hey, I tell you what,

228
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,218
when we'’re outta here,

229
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:57,481
you meet me in my block
in my neighborhood,

230
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,614
and you put your money
where your mouth is.

231
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:01,572
You'’re on.Okay. We got a deal.

232
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:04,532
Yeah. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing? Come on.

233
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:06,229
It'’s okay.

234
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:07,551
Who'’s the officer in charge?

235
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:08,323
I gotta talk to him.

236
00:20:08,362 --> 00:20:10,277
That would be General Carroll.

237
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:13,584
That old puffer?

238
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:16,479
Yep. Makes sense. No wonder

239
00:20:16,503 --> 00:20:18,415
these stitches hurt.

240
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:20,200
Hey, he does what he can.

241
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,816
Hope you didn'’t use
that hand on me.

242
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,471
I got it
under control. How'’s that?

243
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,169
I use a heavy bag.

244
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:35,954
Heavy bag. Is that right? Wow.

245
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,783
You are from Brooklyn.

246
00:20:38,957 --> 00:20:40,350
Yeah.

247
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:43,310
Well tell you what, Doc,

248
00:20:45,137 --> 00:20:46,871
you need to take me
to see the general.

249
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:47,895
It'’s important.

250
00:21:00,152 --> 00:21:01,545
Sir, I'’d like to introduce...

251
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,243
You didn'’t say the password.

252
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:06,246
Password?

253
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:11,555
There you go. How'’s this?
Work for you?

254
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:20,999
I see you brought the
good stuff over here, sir.

255
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,654
It'’s my private stash.

256
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,050
Man of good taste.
You live up to the legend.

257
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,577
I needed that.

258
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:37,059
Awful rude of me
not to introduce myself

259
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:39,235
before drinking you dry, Sir.

260
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:40,410
Major Porter.

261
00:21:41,672 --> 00:21:43,239
Just call me Jake.

262
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:45,126
I know who you are. Well-known

263
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,460
in certain circles, sir.

264
00:21:49,114 --> 00:21:51,465
Well, I was a bit prolific
in my younger years.

265
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:53,945
Some say that made me a target.
I say that'’s the whole

266
00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:54,969
goddamn point.

267
00:21:56,513 --> 00:21:57,558
Cheers to that.

268
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:02,650
What can I do for you, Major?

269
00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:06,814
Well,
I wanted to meet the legend

270
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:08,395
and to warn you, sir.

271
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:10,745
Warn me?

272
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:13,894
Me and my men were doing
a sweep down the hill

273
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,707
and we were ambushed.
Most of us were wiped out

274
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:18,392
besides myself and the Private

275
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,623
who almost bled to death.

276
00:22:21,582 --> 00:22:22,769
I laid low for a couple hours,

277
00:22:22,793 --> 00:22:23,821
but I overheard one of them

278
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:26,391
talking about an
attack on this facility

279
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:28,240
led by Field Marshal Fukuda.

280
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:30,166
A real nasty son of a bitch,
in case you never

281
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,765
heard of him.

282
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:32,070
I know who he is.

283
00:22:34,246 --> 00:22:36,161
When'’s this attack
supposed to happen?

284
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:38,773
That, I don'’t know, sir.

285
00:22:38,947 --> 00:22:40,632
I was ambushed again
before I could hear

286
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:41,253
anything else.

287
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:43,212
That'’s where those
fresh wounds came from.

288
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,170
All right.

289
00:22:47,477 --> 00:22:49,005
And what do you want me to do

290
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:50,132
with this information?

291
00:22:58,227 --> 00:22:59,533
Radio it in, sir?

292
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,867
Well, I can certainly try,
but they don'’t much care

293
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:04,891
what happens out here.

294
00:23:06,148 --> 00:23:07,758
Well then, I'’d say
ready your men.

295
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:09,281
Take a look around, Major.

296
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:12,372
We got a few dozen wounded
GIs and half of them

297
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:14,548
can barely walk,
let alone fight.

298
00:23:16,593 --> 00:23:20,336
You got 127,000 US soldiers
deployed out here

299
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,938
and you'’re telling
me you can'’t get

300
00:23:21,962 --> 00:23:22,590
one of them out?

301
00:23:22,643 --> 00:23:24,340
Anything else, Major?

302
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:28,300
We'’re sharing a toast
here, sir.

303
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,407
But we have a
situation and this is what

304
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:31,216
you'’re gonna do

305
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:33,031
with the information
you'’re blessed with?

306
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:37,397
You'’re welcome to leave
anytime you want.

307
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:41,183
Then we'’re fucked.

308
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:44,099
And now would be a good time.

309
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,407
But then you have no one, sir.

310
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:55,153
I'’m sorry, sir.

311
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:57,678
No need to apologize, Vic.

312
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:01,377
That'’ll be all.

313
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:05,642
Yes, sir.

314
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:09,864
Hey, Porter. What?

315
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:12,170
That intel. When'’s it
supposed to happen?

316
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:13,998
I don'’t know.

317
00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:15,369
I can go back and
try to plead your case

318
00:24:15,393 --> 00:24:15,846
to the General.

319
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,480
This ain'’t no case, buddy.

320
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:20,570
Look. He'’s having a bad day
and might be a little drunk.

321
00:24:20,744 --> 00:24:22,311
Don'’t apologize for him, okay?

322
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:23,965
It'’s not your responsibility.

323
00:24:25,357 --> 00:24:26,576
So what do we do?

324
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,187
You ever seen combat?

325
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:33,453
Don'’t "Oh" me. I'’m asking
you a question.

326
00:24:33,627 --> 00:24:34,851
Have you ever been in combat?

327
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:35,716
Or do you hide behind

328
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,474
your scalpel and your syringe

329
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:38,806
full of morphine all day?

330
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,503
Yeah, I did my basic training.

331
00:24:40,677 --> 00:24:43,637
That'’s not what I asked.
Have you ever seen combat?

332
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:47,292
No.

333
00:24:49,251 --> 00:24:51,514
Patching up kids from Missouri,

334
00:24:51,688 --> 00:24:53,184
it'’s a lot different
to witnessing

335
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:53,995
a 50-caliber shell

336
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:57,032
rip through a man'’s chest,
and some of these guys

337
00:24:57,056 --> 00:24:58,056
are your friends.

338
00:24:58,782 --> 00:25:00,001
The sound.

339
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:02,569
That sickening crunch
of blood and bone.

340
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:04,614
The seconds
that feel like hours.

341
00:25:04,788 --> 00:25:06,660
And then you'’re waiting.
You'’re just,

342
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,160
you'’re waiting
for the next bullet

343
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:08,618
to hit you

344
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,425
in the back of your
own fucking head

345
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:11,142
and it'’s over,

346
00:25:11,316 --> 00:25:12,622
and over, and over again.

347
00:25:14,711 --> 00:25:16,821
I put these kids back together

348
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:18,106
day in and day out.

349
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,891
I seen what happens
over and over.

350
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:24,085
Okay. But you ain'’t seen

351
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:25,113
what'’s coming,

352
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:27,520
and maybe you can
understand why I'’m so

353
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:28,856
upset with the General.

354
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,945
This guy used to be
a fucking war hero.

355
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,392
Now,
he'’s just a shadow of his own reputation

356
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:35,645
when we need him.

357
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:38,256
So what do we do?

358
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:43,218
We evacuate, Doc.

359
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:47,004
To where? What?

360
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,661
We'’re understaffed
and we'’re knee-deep

361
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:49,287
in wounded guys.

362
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:50,747
Some of '’em can'’t even walk.

363
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:53,924
Everybody does their part.
Whoever can fight, fights.

364
00:26:07,764 --> 00:26:10,506
This, this, or this? Yeah.

365
00:26:11,942 --> 00:26:13,509
Are you sure? Sure.

366
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:20,734
Faster, faster. Do it like
your lives depend on it.

367
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:24,128
It'’s not fast enough,
Sergeant, move.

368
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,655
Hey, five bucks if you
kick his ass.

369
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:32,310
Can you do it?
Can you punch him?

370
00:26:41,537 --> 00:26:43,713
Well, who woke up
the devil, now?

371
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,281
You should be resting.

372
00:26:47,151 --> 00:26:48,675
I, I, I can'’t.

373
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:50,981
This is the side I sleep on.
It don'’t feel so good.

374
00:26:54,724 --> 00:26:56,465
I guess that'’s it.

375
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:59,555
I guess I really did
die in here.

376
00:27:00,556 --> 00:27:03,298
Excuse me? Oh, ignore him.

377
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:05,050
He'’s been rambling
on like that ever since

378
00:27:05,074 --> 00:27:05,592
he woke up.

379
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:08,745
I can'’t believe
what I'’m seeing here

380
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:10,522
right in front of me.

381
00:27:12,394 --> 00:27:14,918
Must have died and got
my ass sent to heaven.

382
00:27:16,224 --> 00:27:19,096
Oh no. I promise
you'’re still alive.

383
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,926
Then how come when I look
around, all I see is angels.

384
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,493
That'’s because you'’re in hell.

385
00:27:25,581 --> 00:27:27,801
My apologies if I
offended any of you.

386
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:30,760
It'’s okay. It'’s just
too much morphine.

387
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:31,935
Not enough.

388
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:36,157
What happens if I take too much?

389
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:39,073
Then it'’s
sweet dreams. Check on you again.

390
00:27:41,466 --> 00:27:43,860
At least I won'’t have
to pick up a gun again.

391
00:27:51,563 --> 00:27:53,000
Hey, you doing okay?

392
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,351
I think so.

393
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:07,623
Where'’d you say you was from?

394
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,235
Paris, Texas?

395
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:16,545
Yeah. That'’s right.
Born and raised.

396
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:28,426
Soldier named Pete,
he'’s tall, dark hair.

397
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:34,563
He said his mama was Cherokee.

398
00:28:36,478 --> 00:28:38,306
We were at
Pearl Harbor together.

399
00:28:39,742 --> 00:28:41,091
He took a bullet for me.

400
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:50,231
He'’s from Powderly.

401
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:53,277
That'’s right outside
Paris, isn'’t it?

402
00:28:53,451 --> 00:28:55,889
Yeah, I'’ve heard of Powderly.

403
00:28:56,977 --> 00:28:59,719
Yeah. Population,
about a hundred.

404
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:03,331
Yeah.

405
00:29:06,073 --> 00:29:07,074
That'’s what he said.

406
00:29:08,858 --> 00:29:10,381
Anyway, you.

407
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,169
You run into him back home,

408
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:21,001
you tell him Ava says,
"Thank you."

409
00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:29,270
Okay. I will.

410
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:32,142
I will.

411
00:30:08,744 --> 00:30:10,572
You know you don'’t have
to hide that from me.

412
00:30:10,746 --> 00:30:11,834
Yeah, yeah, I know.

413
00:30:14,402 --> 00:30:16,273
The Major'’s a real asshole,
isn'’t he?

414
00:30:17,927 --> 00:30:20,060
It'’s how they manufacture '’em.

415
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:21,888
Maybe we should
order a factory recall.

416
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,761
Fortunately, these bastards
tend to get results.

417
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:29,243
Maybe.

418
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:33,943
How'’s that kid doing?

419
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:36,685
You'’ll need to narrow it down

420
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,314
if you want an answer

421
00:30:37,338 --> 00:30:38,818
I didn'’t pull outta my ass.

422
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:42,299
The Southern boy, the amputee.

423
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,087
Oh, him. Big Tex.

424
00:30:48,653 --> 00:30:50,059
Well,
aside from trying to come to terms

425
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:50,762
with losing an arm,

426
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:52,808
I'’d say he'’s doing
as well as he can

427
00:30:52,832 --> 00:30:53,920
given the situation.

428
00:30:54,094 --> 00:30:55,651
Morphine'’s really
working wonders

429
00:30:55,675 --> 00:30:56,675
with his inhibitions.

430
00:30:56,836 --> 00:30:58,076
Kid'’s coming out of his shell.

431
00:31:02,406 --> 00:31:03,755
Who'’s he flirting with?

432
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,280
Take your pick.

433
00:31:06,454 --> 00:31:07,794
Well, he'’s out of his league.

434
00:31:07,818 --> 00:31:08,978
He doesn'’t stand a chance.

435
00:31:09,152 --> 00:31:10,703
He'’s pretty charming.
You should go watch him

436
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:11,652
before he passes out again.

437
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:12,982
Yeah, from the morphine?

438
00:31:13,156 --> 00:31:14,592
From one of them slugging him.

439
00:32:04,164 --> 00:32:06,993
Major, my weapon!
Give me my weapon!

440
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:08,820
It'’s okay. It'’s okay.

441
00:32:09,604 --> 00:32:11,258
Take a breath. Relax.

442
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:13,999
There you go.

443
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,392
It hurts like hell.

444
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,742
I'’m sure it does,
but you can handle it.

445
00:32:20,745 --> 00:32:22,878
Where are we? We'’re in
a hospital facility.

446
00:32:23,052 --> 00:32:25,185
Just outside our perimeter.
We'’re all good.

447
00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:27,448
They'’re coming for us?

448
00:32:49,774 --> 00:32:50,862
What the hell was that?

449
00:32:53,822 --> 00:32:54,822
No rest for the wicked.

450
00:33:08,358 --> 00:33:11,318
I'’m gonna get you home,
soldier.

451
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:12,972
I'’m gonna get you home.

452
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:26,997
I figured I'’d find
you two out here

453
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:28,021
without weapons.

454
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,876
We don'’t get issued guns.
Don'’t gimme that shit.

455
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:35,619
You'’re soldiers!
Arm yourselves!

456
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:23,014
Oh my God.
They'’re coming for us.

457
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:24,973
Shh! Be quiet.

458
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:29,934
You can fucking
hear that, can'’t you?

459
00:35:32,894 --> 00:35:34,200
Get your shit together.

460
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:40,989
McGovern, we got evacs!

461
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:07,102
Take cover! Take cover!
Get down!

462
00:36:32,997 --> 00:36:34,347
Remember your training.

463
00:39:36,964 --> 00:39:38,966
That was just the first wave.

464
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,968
There'’ll be more whether
we'’re ready or not.

465
00:39:41,142 --> 00:39:43,492
Doc, what have you got?
I ain'’t feeling so good.

466
00:39:45,276 --> 00:39:46,321
I got it.

467
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:51,848
Sir?

468
00:39:55,504 --> 00:39:58,691
Move these people
to a safe space.

469
00:39:58,715 --> 00:39:59,769
Secure.

470
00:39:59,943 --> 00:40:01,871
I need to get back
to my office and burn

471
00:40:01,895 --> 00:40:03,077
all sensitive documents.

472
00:40:11,259 --> 00:40:12,565
Sir?

473
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,656
Yeah. Carry on, gentlemen.

474
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:19,659
Yes, sir.

475
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:25,447
It'’s good to have him back.

476
00:40:27,231 --> 00:40:28,537
So, what next?

477
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:33,063
We radio for help
and get the hell outta here.

478
00:40:33,237 --> 00:40:35,936
That'’s a negative.
Not possible.

479
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,155
Why not? It'’s the first place
they went.

480
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:39,896
It'’s in a million pieces.

481
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,638
Is it fixable? I doubt it.

482
00:40:42,812 --> 00:40:46,207
Shit.Okay.
You got a basement level?

483
00:40:48,122 --> 00:40:49,210
Kind of.

484
00:40:49,384 --> 00:40:50,777
Is it big enough
to hold everyone?

485
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,344
Course not. Well, we work
with what we got.

486
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:55,518
We move in groups.
We need to make a sweep

487
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:56,217
of this place.

488
00:40:56,391 --> 00:40:58,828
See what we can find.
Who knows this place best?

489
00:40:59,002 --> 00:41:00,221
Most likely we do.Yep.

490
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:02,528
Okay. You take backup,
take a sweep.

491
00:41:02,702 --> 00:41:04,771
Anything you can find.
Guns, hammers, nails, razor blades,

492
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,550
anything. You got it?

493
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:06,574
Got it. Got it.

494
00:41:06,662 --> 00:41:08,751
Isaac. Clear the basement.

495
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,536
And give my man here a gun.

496
00:41:11,406 --> 00:41:12,581
Thank you, Major.

497
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:14,254
You owe me a bottle
a whiskey, Private.

498
00:41:14,278 --> 00:41:16,280
Two bottles
for respect. Sounds good.

499
00:41:17,238 --> 00:41:18,413
You got any flares?

500
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:22,330
I'’m sure we do.Okay.

501
00:41:22,504 --> 00:41:23,505
Let'’s move.

502
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,758
These? Go on, yes, yes.

503
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,891
Come on, hurry. Come on!

504
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:04,198
Okay.

505
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,032
Mia, on this side, check.
Inessa, over here.

506
00:42:12,206 --> 00:42:14,077
Anything we can use.
Medications,

507
00:42:14,251 --> 00:42:16,123
bandages, weapons. Anything.

508
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,256
Oh, perfect.

509
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,519
Inessa, on this side.

510
00:42:21,476 --> 00:42:23,826
Anything sharp, medication.

511
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:50,418
Yeah, yes.

512
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:54,403
Come on, girls, we gotta move.

513
00:42:54,553 --> 00:42:55,858
This is good, right?

514
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,212
Whatever you can carry.

515
00:43:11,526 --> 00:43:14,790
Well, there it is.

516
00:43:14,964 --> 00:43:18,011
There'’s what? Stress reliever,
right?

517
00:43:19,273 --> 00:43:22,232
By the way, wonderful job
being off the mainland.

518
00:43:22,406 --> 00:43:24,495
That'’s a potato sack
I found in the jungle.

519
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,586
Filled it with sand,
right? Yeah.

520
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,968
Yeah, well, I'’ll tell you what.

521
00:43:28,992 --> 00:43:30,200
Maybe you can help me fix that

522
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,199
and hang it back up
before we leave,

523
00:43:32,373 --> 00:43:33,940
maybe I'’ll take a few swings.

524
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:34,880
Well, I think you'’re gonna

525
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:35,526
have plenty opportunity

526
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,552
to hit other things
other than a potato sack.

527
00:43:38,727 --> 00:43:40,990
This works. Let'’s get
'’em down here.

528
00:44:36,611 --> 00:44:39,005
Get down, get down! Get down!

529
00:44:43,226 --> 00:44:45,533
Move, move, move! Move!
Let'’s go!

530
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:50,712
He'’s hit!

531
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:54,498
Japanese. Cover me.

532
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,636
Stay with me. Stay with me.

533
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:05,771
Here you go.

534
00:45:09,122 --> 00:45:10,863
Cover me. Go, go, go, go!

535
00:45:41,023 --> 00:45:42,024
He'’s gone.

536
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:44,984
Morphine! I need some
morphine here!

537
00:45:45,158 --> 00:45:46,899
I'’m coming! You'’re wasting your time.

538
00:45:47,073 --> 00:45:49,640
Shut up. Stay with me.
Come on, man.

539
00:45:49,815 --> 00:45:51,294
Stay with me.

540
00:45:55,429 --> 00:45:57,736
Stay with me. Shit!

541
00:46:05,787 --> 00:46:07,833
I told you, you were
wasting your time.

542
00:46:11,184 --> 00:46:14,056
That man had a wife
and a daughter.

543
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,190
Everyone has a wife
and a daughter.

544
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,368
You hear me? Let it go, Vic.

545
00:46:21,542 --> 00:46:22,935
Listen to your friend.

546
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:24,989
There'’s gonna be another
wave coming down here.

547
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:27,330
And we don'’t want to be
here when that happens.

548
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:29,985
He'’s right. We need to move.

549
00:46:36,644 --> 00:46:37,688
Okay.

550
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:40,859
Let'’s see if we can
salvage that thing.

551
00:46:40,996 --> 00:46:43,085
It may come in
handy later, ok. Right away, sir.

552
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:44,565
Make it happen.

553
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,262
I'’m gonna clear the holes.

554
00:46:49,788 --> 00:46:51,137
Goddamn it.

555
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:56,185
Here! Come on, hurry up!
Here, here, move! Here!

556
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:58,057
Come on, come on!

557
00:46:58,231 --> 00:46:59,511
Let'’s move, move! Hurry! Hurry!

558
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:01,321
These are too far apart.

559
00:47:01,495 --> 00:47:02,351
We gotta move
them closer together.

560
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:02,951
We gotta fit everybody.

561
00:47:02,975 --> 00:47:05,151
Come on, we gotta have
room for everybody, down.

562
00:47:06,065 --> 00:47:07,196
In a row, like this.

563
00:51:18,317 --> 00:51:19,318
First kill?

564
00:51:30,285 --> 00:51:31,939
Just remember something.

565
00:51:32,113 --> 00:51:33,767
If it wasn'’t him, it was me.

566
00:51:33,941 --> 00:51:36,596
Then it was you. You got that?

567
00:51:39,207 --> 00:51:40,252
Got it.

568
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:44,734
Too much caffeine?

569
00:51:47,215 --> 00:51:48,651
I know what it is.

570
00:51:48,825 --> 00:51:50,317
It started after I deployed,

571
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:51,350
I, I can control it.

572
00:51:52,873 --> 00:51:54,179
Thanks for having my back.

573
00:51:54,353 --> 00:51:57,138
I hope to return
the favor. Let'’s move.

574
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:15,417
I think, I think I need
a shot of morphine.

575
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:16,897
Oh.

576
00:52:17,985 --> 00:52:19,552
You have more,

577
00:52:19,726 --> 00:52:22,032
and there won'’t be any
for the rest of us.

578
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:25,340
My nerves.

579
00:52:25,514 --> 00:52:27,560
Hey, son, what I tell you?

580
00:52:27,734 --> 00:52:29,312
The nerves ain'’t gonna
do no good for you

581
00:52:29,336 --> 00:52:30,336
around here.

582
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,914
A shot of morphine
will keep me calm.

583
00:52:34,088 --> 00:52:37,047
A shot of morphine
is gonna knock you out.

584
00:52:45,186 --> 00:52:48,407
I need you aware,
'’cause like Major said,

585
00:52:48,581 --> 00:52:51,932
I need you to have
my front and my back.

586
00:52:54,413 --> 00:52:56,110
At least I'’d die peacefully.

587
00:52:57,894 --> 00:53:01,438
You not gonna die.
You not going die.

588
00:53:01,462 --> 00:53:03,030
Look at me, son.

589
00:53:04,205 --> 00:53:05,205
What'’s your name?

590
00:53:05,293 --> 00:53:06,903
Adell Dollins.

591
00:53:07,077 --> 00:53:09,334
Adell Dollins. I like the name.

592
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:10,358
Adell Dollins.

593
00:53:10,472 --> 00:53:13,214
Repeat after me Adell.
I'’m not going die.

594
00:53:13,388 --> 00:53:16,217
I'’m not going to die. Ooh, louder, Adell.

595
00:53:16,391 --> 00:53:18,045
I'’m not going die. I'’m not going die.

596
00:53:18,219 --> 00:53:21,048
I'’m not gonna die! I'’m not gonna die!

597
00:53:22,049 --> 00:53:23,616
Yeah, God got a plan

598
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,317
and look what we got here.

599
00:53:32,102 --> 00:53:33,365
Shit.

600
00:53:38,631 --> 00:53:39,849
Not bad.

601
00:53:43,723 --> 00:53:46,856
Where you from, kid? California.

602
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,250
You should have enlisted.

603
00:53:49,424 --> 00:53:51,644
Could always use a pair
of hands like yours.

604
00:53:53,907 --> 00:53:56,779
I tried. What do you mean,
you tried?

605
00:54:00,174 --> 00:54:01,219
And?

606
00:54:09,314 --> 00:54:11,098
Jesus Christ, that was close.

607
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:14,057
Y'’all boys ready?

608
00:54:26,069 --> 00:54:27,114
Hold.

609
00:55:09,156 --> 00:55:10,418
No!

610
00:55:15,684 --> 00:55:16,859
Porter!

611
00:55:23,126 --> 00:55:24,812
I think it went clean through.

612
00:55:24,836 --> 00:55:25,390
You okay?

613
00:55:25,564 --> 00:55:27,130
I know you'’re not, let'’s go.

614
00:55:27,305 --> 00:55:29,263
Is he good? Yeah.

615
00:55:29,437 --> 00:55:32,745
Over the shoulder, big man.
There you go. Let'’s move.

616
00:56:20,793 --> 00:56:22,316
What are you going to do?

617
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,655
You'’re going to die.

618
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:06,534
Come on, put me down.

619
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:10,495
Empty.

620
00:57:11,452 --> 00:57:13,236
Your shoulder, it'’s not lethal.

621
00:57:15,108 --> 00:57:16,152
I'’m out.

622
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,808
The General'’s got guns
in his office.

623
00:57:21,244 --> 00:57:23,421
Give me a hand, come on. Up!

624
00:57:40,002 --> 00:57:41,047
Guys.

625
00:57:52,232 --> 00:57:53,407
He went down fighting.

626
00:57:56,671 --> 00:57:57,846
He died a hero.

627
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:10,293
It'’s empty.

628
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:14,950
Same.

629
00:58:17,866 --> 00:58:20,565
I'’m gonna lie down guys.
I don'’t feel so good.

630
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,449
They took everything.

631
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,239
You okay?

632
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:49,898
No. No.

633
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,818
So it will be with the
resurrection of the dead.

634
00:58:58,646 --> 00:59:02,290
The body that is sown
is perishable is raised

635
00:59:02,314 --> 00:59:03,521
imperishable.

636
00:59:05,305 --> 00:59:08,438
It is sown weak.
It is raised with power.

637
00:59:09,788 --> 00:59:12,530
It is sown and dishonored
is raised in glory.

638
00:59:19,232 --> 00:59:21,190
It is sown as a natural body.

639
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:26,326
It rises as a spiritual body.

640
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,933
If there is a spiritual body,

641
00:59:29,957 --> 00:59:31,331
there is a natural body.

642
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,248
Corinthians.

643
00:59:40,862 --> 00:59:43,337
That verse got me
through a lot of long nights

644
00:59:43,361 --> 00:59:44,361
since I left home.

645
00:59:46,999 --> 00:59:48,304
How long you been here?

646
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,265
You know.

647
00:59:53,135 --> 00:59:54,572
I used to count the days.

648
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:58,880
Now, I don'’t remember
the day I shipped out.

649
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:02,227
The good thing is
I don'’t obsess over

650
01:00:02,251 --> 01:00:03,251
time anymore. I just,

651
01:00:05,104 --> 01:00:06,975
I just wanna get home someday.

652
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,283
Yeah. You and me both.

653
01:00:16,942 --> 01:00:18,683
Boroughs coming together, yeah?

654
01:00:21,163 --> 01:00:22,512
Boroughs coming together.

655
01:00:23,862 --> 01:00:26,081
We ain'’t that different
after all, are we?

656
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,606
No. No, we'’re not.

657
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:36,091
How about them out there?

658
01:00:41,444 --> 01:00:43,229
I figure they'’re just
as scared as we are.

659
01:00:43,403 --> 01:00:47,494
Soldiers following orders.

660
01:00:52,717 --> 01:00:53,935
And I quit.

661
01:00:55,545 --> 01:00:56,764
Why deprive yourself, Doc?

662
01:00:56,938 --> 01:00:58,984
It could be your last
night on this earth.

663
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:04,250
A forgotten borough
finally making some sense.

664
01:01:04,424 --> 01:01:09,211
Hey. Cuz I'’m from Jersey?

665
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:17,263
You know how you could tell
somebody'’s from Jersey?

666
01:01:17,437 --> 01:01:18,481
How?

667
01:01:20,614 --> 01:01:22,616
They never shut
the fuck up about it.

668
01:01:24,096 --> 01:01:25,924
You don'’t hear me
denying that one.

669
01:01:32,974 --> 01:01:36,804
Sweet Lord. That tastes
good right now.

670
01:01:36,978 --> 01:01:38,545
There you go, see?

671
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:39,882
Who says people from Jersey

672
01:01:39,906 --> 01:01:40,906
don'’t have any taste.

673
01:01:40,982 --> 01:01:46,379
Just don'’t let my wife know.
She'’d actually kill me.

674
01:01:46,553 --> 01:01:48,892
She'’d say I'’m setting
a piss-poor example

675
01:01:48,916 --> 01:01:49,916
for my kid.

676
01:01:50,818 --> 01:01:52,428
You got kids, Porter?

677
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,042
Me? No.

678
01:01:58,086 --> 01:01:59,218
Not that I know of, anyways.

679
01:01:59,392 --> 01:02:00,872
Oh, is that right?

680
01:02:01,046 --> 01:02:02,763
No, I'’m just saying that
I did a lot of traveling.

681
01:02:02,787 --> 01:02:05,572
So you know, I wouldn'’t be
surprised if there'’s some

682
01:02:05,746 --> 01:02:07,332
hard-nosed little bastard
running around,

683
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,876
out there somewhere
that looks like me.

684
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:11,534
How about you?

685
01:02:16,235 --> 01:02:18,237
Me and my wife, Jenny,
we want kids.

686
01:02:18,411 --> 01:02:21,153
It'’s just not in the cards yet.

687
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:24,199
You didn'’t try before you left?

688
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:28,116
Oh, like drunk jackrabbits.
It just didn'’t happen.

689
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:31,337
It will. And when it does,

690
01:02:31,511 --> 01:02:32,756
do your best to keep outta

691
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:33,780
situations like this

692
01:02:33,861 --> 01:02:36,734
'’cause this ain'’t
no place for no kid.

693
01:02:39,345 --> 01:02:41,390
That'’s all we can hope for,

694
01:02:41,564 --> 01:02:43,088
that our kids do
better than we do.

695
01:02:44,263 --> 01:02:46,265
That'’s what I'’m
hoping for my boy.

696
01:02:46,439 --> 01:02:47,614
Damn smart kid.

697
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:52,010
Lot smarter than I was
at his age. Early bloomer.

698
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:56,710
Now, you just gotta
get him outta Jersey.

699
01:02:56,884 --> 01:02:59,288
At least to UCLA like
this smarmy bastard,

700
01:02:59,312 --> 01:03:00,105
right here.

701
01:03:00,279 --> 01:03:02,107
Oh there it is. There it is.

702
01:03:05,893 --> 01:03:08,116
What'’s the first
thing you'’re gonna do

703
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,331
the day you get back?

704
01:03:09,505 --> 01:03:10,744
Who you'’re talking to,
me or him?

705
01:03:10,768 --> 01:03:12,421
Whoever fucking answers first.

706
01:03:12,595 --> 01:03:13,667
I don'’t know, he'’s your buddy.

707
01:03:13,691 --> 01:03:14,051
You tell me.

708
01:03:14,075 --> 01:03:15,642
Hey, be my guest.

709
01:03:15,816 --> 01:03:17,958
Why, you embarrassed?
You hiding something

710
01:03:17,982 --> 01:03:18,688
over there?

711
01:03:18,863 --> 01:03:19,951
I'’ll get it outta you.

712
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:21,561
Try it. I'’m Irish.

713
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:26,914
Me? You know, I never really
thought about it that much.

714
01:03:30,657 --> 01:03:32,137
I'’m thinking maybe a ball game.

715
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:34,704
First pitch of the season.

716
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:38,448
Smell of that fresh green grass,

717
01:03:38,472 --> 01:03:40,101
the tall beer in my hand,

718
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:41,494
a beautiful woman on my arm.

719
01:03:42,843 --> 01:03:44,920
One of those New
York stadium hot dogs

720
01:03:44,944 --> 01:03:45,628
in my mouth.

721
01:03:45,803 --> 01:03:47,674
Yeah, it'’s simple.

722
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:50,242
That'’s what I look forward to.

723
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:52,548
Sounds like
the perfect day to me.

724
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,508
How about you?

725
01:03:57,423 --> 01:03:59,164
I'’m from Jersey.
You wouldn'’t like it.

726
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:01,427
Try me.

727
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,997
Would love to take
my wife and kid out.

728
01:04:06,171 --> 01:04:10,088
Stop in each state.
Show them the country.

729
01:04:11,654 --> 01:04:17,182
Travel. Show my boy what
his dad was out protecting.

730
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:20,620
Show him why.

731
01:04:23,144 --> 01:04:24,885
That sounds nice.

732
01:04:25,059 --> 01:04:26,516
Just skip the rest
of Jersey and parts

733
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:27,124
of Connecticut.

734
01:04:27,148 --> 01:04:29,020
Other than that,
it'’s just fucking beautiful.

735
01:04:29,194 --> 01:04:30,630
I guess so.

736
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,331
I haven'’t heard
anything in a while.

737
01:04:38,464 --> 01:04:40,814
Maybe we should get him
down with the others.

738
01:04:40,988 --> 01:04:42,903
Wait for the reinforcements
to find us.

739
01:04:44,774 --> 01:04:47,429
That'’s if anyone comes.
They don'’t call this

740
01:04:47,603 --> 01:04:49,257
Purple Heart Ridge for nothing.

741
01:04:50,911 --> 01:04:51,912
Let'’s get outta here.

742
01:05:01,008 --> 01:05:03,402
What do you plan on doing
with that thing?

743
01:05:03,576 --> 01:05:05,291
You ever see the
Babe hit one out

744
01:05:05,315 --> 01:05:06,315
of Yankee stadium?

745
01:05:07,101 --> 01:05:08,102
Dozens of times.

746
01:05:18,069 --> 01:05:19,070
Are you good?

747
01:05:22,334 --> 01:05:24,989
As long as there'’s
a nice piece-of-shit cot

748
01:05:25,163 --> 01:05:26,723
with someone else'’s
blood smeared in it

749
01:05:26,773 --> 01:05:29,907
waiting for me downstairs,
I'’m ready for anything.

750
01:05:30,081 --> 01:05:32,431
Then keep up. Come on.

751
01:05:32,605 --> 01:05:34,520
Guess you don'’t know
Jersey very well.

752
01:06:14,821 --> 01:06:16,083
Hey, Doc.

753
01:06:16,257 --> 01:06:19,826
Ted Williams, 127
home runs in five years.

754
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,567
You think he'’ll catch the Babe?

755
01:06:21,741 --> 01:06:23,961
I think the Babe'’s
record'’s pretty safe.

756
01:06:29,879 --> 01:06:31,316
Let'’s see what we can do.

757
01:07:28,547 --> 01:07:30,331
All right, clear the chamber!

758
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,060
Get out of there,
get out of the way,

759
01:07:32,084 --> 01:07:32,594
come on!

760
01:07:32,768 --> 01:07:35,423
Get my bag. Go get some
equipment, right now.

761
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:38,026
Come on. No, no, no, come on.

762
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:39,384
I could save you.

763
01:07:39,558 --> 01:07:40,994
Yes, I can.

764
01:07:41,168 --> 01:07:42,778
No, you can'’t.

765
01:07:45,564 --> 01:07:47,305
He hit the femoral artery.

766
01:07:49,263 --> 01:07:50,612
It won'’t take too long now.

767
01:07:53,789 --> 01:07:55,269
Protect them.

768
01:07:59,795 --> 01:08:01,710
No, no, no, no, no.

769
01:08:01,884 --> 01:08:06,106
Vic, make sure my boy gets this.

770
01:08:08,848 --> 01:08:11,068
He'’s not old enough
to understand it yet,

771
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:16,986
but he will be.

772
01:08:43,274 --> 01:08:44,797
He was a good man.

773
01:08:48,453 --> 01:08:50,321
They'’re gonna make it down here.
You know that.

774
01:08:50,345 --> 01:08:51,465
It'’s just a matter of time.

775
01:08:55,068 --> 01:08:56,374
Then we'’ll keep fighting.

776
01:09:05,513 --> 01:09:06,906
I'’m gonna take the halls.

777
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,517
I'’m gonna kill as many
of these guys as I can.

778
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:11,737
Anybody makes it down here,
it'’s on you.

779
01:09:11,911 --> 01:09:13,217
I'’m coming with you.

780
01:09:17,308 --> 01:09:18,526
If I don'’t make it back here,

781
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,659
I want you to know
it'’s been an honor.

782
01:09:21,225 --> 01:09:22,226
Likewise.

783
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:27,100
You keep an eye on him.

784
01:09:28,841 --> 01:09:29,929
Don'’t worry.

785
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:31,626
Got him covered.

786
01:09:32,975 --> 01:09:34,803
You good to hold fort
for me, Private?

787
01:09:36,153 --> 01:09:38,329
Well, we'’re in luck.

788
01:09:38,503 --> 01:09:40,418
'’Cause I just happened
to learn from the best.

789
01:09:41,332 --> 01:09:42,811
Good whiskey.

790
01:09:42,985 --> 01:09:46,075
Great whiskey, two bottles.
You just make it back.

791
01:09:47,947 --> 01:09:49,427
You remember our bet, right?

792
01:09:51,385 --> 01:09:53,039
You still think you can win?

793
01:09:53,213 --> 01:09:54,258
You'’re damn right.

794
01:10:04,093 --> 01:10:05,965
Loser buys Dodger tickets.

795
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,015
Get the door.

796
01:11:37,361 --> 01:11:38,579
Quiet.

797
01:11:55,466 --> 01:11:56,510
Steady.

798
01:13:21,987 --> 01:13:23,031
Shit.

799
01:13:40,832 --> 01:13:41,876
Steady.

800
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,095
Steady.

801
01:14:01,766 --> 01:14:03,768
Steady.

802
01:17:29,364 --> 01:17:30,364
This is the last one.

803
01:17:30,496 --> 01:17:31,932
Make it count.

804
01:18:24,942 --> 01:18:26,030
I'’m out!

805
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:35,126
Good shot, kid.

806
01:18:40,261 --> 01:18:43,047
That'’s how we do it
in Paris, Texas.

807
01:18:43,221 --> 01:18:45,223
Oh my god! Please, no!

808
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:48,835
Don'’t die!

809
01:18:50,794 --> 01:18:52,360
Come on, come on.

810
01:18:55,102 --> 01:18:56,103
Don'’t die.

811
01:19:12,903 --> 01:19:14,121
You did good.

812
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:19,578
Is that it?

813
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:21,275
Is that all?

814
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,974
I'’m sure there'’s more coming.

815
01:20:24,148 --> 01:20:25,466
I don'’t think we could handle

816
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:26,490
another wave like that.

817
01:20:28,935 --> 01:20:31,329
Is this everything
we had in the building?

818
01:20:31,503 --> 01:20:33,853
As far as we know, yeah.

819
01:20:34,941 --> 01:20:36,595
Goddamn.

820
01:20:36,769 --> 01:20:38,389
We could use their ammo,
but that won'’t last

821
01:20:38,413 --> 01:20:38,945
the night.

822
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:40,827
Yeah.
That'’ll buy us some time, but that'’s

823
01:20:40,851 --> 01:20:41,519
not the solution.

824
01:20:41,687 --> 01:20:43,471
So what now?

825
01:20:44,255 --> 01:20:46,213
We just sit here and die?

826
01:20:54,613 --> 01:20:56,267
Maybe we won'’t have to.

827
01:20:57,311 --> 01:20:59,226
I don'’t think that'’s enough.

828
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,099
It'’s a flare gun.

829
01:21:04,144 --> 01:21:06,103
Maybe we can get
some reinforcements.

830
01:21:07,539 --> 01:21:08,583
Are you sure?

831
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:14,676
I'’m out of other options.

832
01:21:14,851 --> 01:21:17,592
Where are you gonna
do this? The roof?

833
01:21:18,942 --> 01:21:21,031
No, I think I'’d be
a target there.

834
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:26,082
Maybe around back.
Maybe there'’s a little

835
01:21:26,106 --> 01:21:27,106
clearing I can go to.

836
01:21:28,821 --> 01:21:31,389
So you just gonna leave us?

837
01:21:31,563 --> 01:21:33,870
Why don'’t you just wait
till Porter gets back?

838
01:21:38,962 --> 01:21:41,138
I don'’t think
Porter'’s coming back.

839
01:21:47,187 --> 01:21:48,362
I'’ll be right back.

840
01:21:49,624 --> 01:21:51,278
You know what'’s out there.

841
01:21:52,671 --> 01:21:53,846
A minefield.

842
01:22:05,902 --> 01:22:10,080
If I'’m not back in 20,
you get everybody you can.

843
01:22:10,254 --> 01:22:13,165
You run like hell
until you find someone

844
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:14,301
friendly, okay?

845
01:22:17,914 --> 01:22:19,393
Hopefully, it won'’t
come to that.

846
01:23:14,796 --> 01:23:15,797
How long has it been?

847
01:23:15,972 --> 01:23:17,495
About two minutes.

848
01:23:17,669 --> 01:23:18,975
That'’s it?

849
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:23,631
Time goes by so slow
when there'’s no gunfire.

850
01:23:23,805 --> 01:23:27,244
Don'’t worry.
He knows what he'’s doing.

851
01:24:23,474 --> 01:24:24,562
He can do it.

852
01:24:28,305 --> 01:24:30,046
He talked me through
losing an arm.

853
01:24:32,309 --> 01:24:34,050
He can make it
through a minefield.

854
01:26:44,789 --> 01:26:45,877
Go!

855
01:26:48,096 --> 01:26:49,141
Go!

856
01:26:50,621 --> 01:26:51,622
Go!

857
01:27:47,852 --> 01:27:53,249
Wait. There it is! He did it.

858
01:28:08,089 --> 01:28:10,831
So it will be with
the resurrection of the dead.

859
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:14,792
The body that is sown
is perishable.

860
01:28:14,966 --> 01:28:16,620
It is raised imperishable.

861
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:20,798
It is sown weak.
It is raised with power.

862
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:24,628
It is sown and dishonored,
is raised in glory.

863
01:28:26,064 --> 01:28:32,505
It is sown as a natural body,
it rises as a spiritual body.

864
01:28:35,465 --> 01:28:38,468
If there is a spiritual body,
there is a natural body.
