2
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:41,804
- Hello?
- <i>Hello.</i>

3
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:43,456
<i>Is Cristina there?</i>

4
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,623
No, she's not available.
May I take a message?

5
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,192
<i>Uh, yeah, well, um...</i>

6
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,669
<i>Yeah, sorry. I'm a friend
from her group...</i>

7
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:51,391
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

8
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,770
From her shit?

9
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:56,002
<i>Um... Look, just tell her
I'm from group.</i>

10
00:01:56,122 --> 00:01:57,940
<i>I'm Charlie,
she's got my number.</i>

11
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,646
Oh, she goes to your group?

12
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,527
<i>I shouldn't have, um...</i>

13
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:04,361
<i>Look, just tell her Charlie called.</i>

14
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,625
And I will do exactly that, Charlie,

15
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:08,680
once you tell me what kind
of group we're talking about...

16
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,002
- Is it AA? NA?
- <i>Look...</i>

17
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:13,459
<i>You sound exactly
like she describes you.</i>

18
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:15,308
Does he talks about me in group?

19
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,092
<i>I don't think I can really talk
about that.</i>

20
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,472
What does she say about me?

21
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,183
<i>Well, she loves you very much.</i>

22
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,980
What does she love
about me?

23
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:27,463
<i>Oh, okay. Well...</i>

24
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:29,631
<i>She loves that you're creative.</i>

25
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:31,893
<i>You love art
and TV and movies.</i>

26
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:34,373
Okay, well,
lots of people love movies.

27
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,782
<i>Yeah, but she says
you love scary movies</i>

28
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,829
<i>and that you guys
have that in common.</i>

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,480
<i>She's proud of making
a fan out of you.</i>

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,060
- She is?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

31
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:48,280
<i>Well, she told me the other
day, she wonders...</i>

32
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:50,799
<i>what's your favorite
scary movie?</i>

33
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:52,515
Uh... <i>The Babadook.</i>

34
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,879
It's an amazing meditation
on motherhood and grief.

35
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:59,330
<i>Isn't that a little fancy pants?</i>

36
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,847
Well, it's elevated horror.

37
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,551
<i>Uh-huh! What does that mean,
"Elevated horror"?</i>

38
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,463
You know, it's scary but with complex
emotional and thematic underpinnings.

39
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,422
It's not just some schlocky,

40
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,191
cheeseball nonsense
with wall-to-wall jump scares.

41
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,059
<i>Hmm.
Sounds kind of boring to me.</i>

42
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:19,530
<i>Have you ever seen</i> Stab?

43
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,579
Once, I think...

44
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:25,040
At a sleepover
when I was, like, 12.

45
00:03:26,096 --> 00:03:30,080
<i>You live in Woodsboro
and you don't know Stab?</i>

46
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,741
<i>Your mother loves that movie.</i>

47
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:33,980
<i>She talks about it all
the time in group.</i>

48
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,747
<i>How well do you remember
the original?</i>

49
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,149
I don't know.

50
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:40,362
I mean, it was super '90s.

51
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:43,923
It was really over-lit
and everyone had weird hair.

52
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,969
<i>Do you remember the beginning?</i>

53
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,010
Not really.

54
00:03:50,153 --> 00:03:51,350
It started with a kill scene, right?

55
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,705
They always started
with a kill scene.

56
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,537
<i>Yeah, that's right.
That's right.</i>

57
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,039
<i>It's a girl at home, alone.</i>

58
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,864
<i>She answers a wrong number
and starts talking with the killer</i>

59
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:03,880
<i>who makes her play a game.</i>

60
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,522
<i>Would you like to
play a game...</i>

61
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:09,792
<i>Tara?</i>

62
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:26,450
<i>All systems armed.</i>

63
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,995
This isn't fucking funny, Amber.

64
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:40,520
<i>I told you, this isn't Amber.</i>

65
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,592
<i>Amber's looking
particularly fetching tonight.</i>

66
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:53,310
<i>She really shouldn't leave her phone
lying around for anyone to clone.</i>

67
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,430
What do you want?

68
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:58,480
<i>I told you,
I want to play a game.</i>

69
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:00,900
Stab <i>movie trivia,</i>
<i>three rounds.</i>

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,410
<i>You call the cops, she dies.</i>

71
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,610
<i>You get a question wrong,
she dies.</i>

72
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,951
<i>Her parents aren't home.</i>

73
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,390
<i>I can be in that room
in 15 seconds.</i>

74
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,899
<i>You want a warmup question?</i>

75
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,628
I told you, I don't know
these movies!

76
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,380
Ask me about
something I do know.

77
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:18,180
Ask me about <i>It Follows.</i>

78
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,902
Ask me about <i>Hereditary.</i>
Ask me about <i>The Witch.</i>

79
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:23,021
<i>In the first</i> Stab <i>movie,</i>

80
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,932
<i>what Woodsboro native
was introduced</i>

81
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:27,868
<i>as the franchise's
main character?</i>

82
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:30,510
It's Sidney Prescott!

83
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,648
It's Sidney Prescott
and she lived on Elm.

84
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:33,690
<i>Correct!</i>

85
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:35,570
<i>You see, you're gonna
do great at this.</i>

86
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,901
<i>Okay, question one...</i>

87
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:40,410
No, I got that one right.
It should count.

88
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,052
<i>Anyone could have
gotten that one right,</i>

89
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,603
<i>Sidney's in every movie
but the last one.</i>

90
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,844
<i>Question one:</i>

91
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,860
<i>Who wrote the original book</i>

92
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,515
<i>that the</i> Stab <i>movies</i>
<i>are based on?</i>

93
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:58,160
The... The chick from TV!

94
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,273
<i>"The chick from TV"
is not gonna cut it, Tara.</i>

95
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:04,310
Gale Weathers!

96
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:07,110
It is Gale Weathers,
you motherfucker!

97
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,199
<i>Correct.</i>

98
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,423
<i>Amber might live
to see the sunrise.</i>

99
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,760
<i>Question two:</i>

100
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,770
<i>Who played the dumb bitch
in the beginning of</i> Stab 1,

101
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:18,870
<i>who answers the phone
and gets carved up by the killer?</i>

102
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,110
Fuck you.

103
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,550
<i>Is that the answer
you're going with?</i>

104
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,821
<i>A non-answer counts
as a wrong answer, Tara.</i>

105
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,347
<i>Time's running out!</i>

106
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,428
<i>Ticktock, ticktock,
ticktock, ticktock...</i>

107
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,450
Heather Graham!

108
00:07:40,305 --> 00:07:42,300
<i>Correct!
You pulled that one out.</i>

109
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,550
<i>Now for the final question:</i>

110
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:48,393
<i>Who was the killer in</i> Stab 1?

111
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:53,210
Oh, I know this one, you fuck.

112
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,482
It's Billy Loomis!

113
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:57,420
It's Billy Loomis,
and he was Sidney's boyfriend,

114
00:07:57,524 --> 00:08:00,527
he was played by Luke Wilson,
and I got you, asshole!

115
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,690
I got it! I got it right!

116
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,750
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, Tara,
but that's just not correct.</i>

117
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:11,510
What?

118
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,580
No, no, no, it is.

119
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,700
It is that is right.

120
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,999
<i>The correct answer is Billy Loomis
and Stu Macher.</i>

121
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,760
<i>There are two killers</i>
<i>in the original</i> Stab.

122
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,950
<i>I'm afraid someone's
got to die now.</i>

123
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,062
No, no, no.
Amber, I'm coming.

124
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,010
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

125
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,680
<i>All systems armed.</i>

126
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,150
The police are on the way,
asshole!

127
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,480
<i>All systems disarmed.</i>

128
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,980
<i>All systems armed.</i>

129
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:22,450
- <i>All systems disarmed</i>
- Oh, my God. No.

130
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:24,110
<i>All systems armed.</i>

131
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,204
<i>All systems disarmed.</i>

132
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,772
<i>All systems armed.</i>

133
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,110
<i>All systems disarmed.</i>

134
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,780
<i>All systems armed.</i>

135
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,010
Hello?

136
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,750
<i>Bonus question, Tara.</i>

137
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:10,520
Please stop!

138
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,223
<i>Do you think I made it
inside your house</i>

139
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,980
<i>before you could rearm?</i>

140
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,550
Help!

141
00:11:11,806 --> 00:11:12,950
No! No, no, no!

142
00:11:44,252 --> 00:11:45,450
Excuse me, miss?

143
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,650
- What'd you just take?
- Your boner pills.

144
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:50,080
Good luck getting it up now.

145
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,010
You, um...

146
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,720
You are my boner pills.

147
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,410
No, No.

148
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,500
You okay?

149
00:12:10,637 --> 00:12:11,610
Yes.

150
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,098
You don't have to check on me all the time.
I'm not breakable.

151
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:16,850
Yeah, this I know.

152
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:22,640
Shit.

153
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,210
- <i>Sam?</i>
- Hey, what's going on?

154
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,080
<i>Tara... was attacked.</i>

155
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,164
What? Is she...

156
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,780
<i>She's alive,
but in bad shape.</i>

157
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,239
<i>She was...</i>

158
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:46,580
<i>stabbed.</i>

159
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:49,918
- Stabbed? What the fuck?
- <i>She made it through surgery</i>

160
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,780
<i>and the doctor said it went well.</i>

161
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:53,520
<i>She's resting now.</i>

162
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:55,510
<i>I know you guys
aren't on the best terms, but...</i>

163
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,010
I'm on my way.

164
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,126
<i>She's gonna be okay, Sam.
We'll see you soon.</i>

165
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,750
Hey, wait, Wes!

166
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,880
<i>Yeah?</i>

167
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,880
Do they know who did this?

168
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,880
<i>It's probably better
if you just come here.</i>

169
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,610
Wes.

170
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:12,172
<i>She said it was someone</i>

171
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:14,374
<i>in a fucking Ghostface mask.</i>

172
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,399
My sister was attacked.

173
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,450
I gotta go.

174
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,140
Wait, hey! Hey, hey hey.
I'm... I'm going with you.

175
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,650
No. No, Richie...

176
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,280
No, Sam.
I'm coming with you.

177
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:35,780
- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

178
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,633
<i>Attention, Panthers.</i>

179
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,620
<i>A reminder that all classes
and school activities</i>

180
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,717
<i>are canceled tomorrow
due to public safety concerns.</i>

181
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,829
That was Sam.

182
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:50,280
- She's coming?
- Yeah.

183
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,216
Watch everything get worse.

184
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,008
All I'm saying is,
with everything going on right now,

185
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,310
I think it's time we take
our relationship to the next,

186
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:00,310
most intimate level.

187
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,930
He wants me to accept
his Find My Fam request.

188
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,810
It's the smartest option with
a would-be killer on the loose.

189
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,271
You know exactly where I am
and I know exactly where you are.

190
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,860
Aw, you can stalk me like
a jealous boyfriend.

191
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:12,400
And you can stalk me
like a jealous boyfriend.

192
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,650
Is this because you two
aren't having sex yet?

193
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,151
You bring up a very good point.

194
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,402
Not that I want to sound
like a stereotypical jock

195
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,623
- trying to get into his girl's pants...
- Great!

196
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,870
Don't do it, Liv.
There's a psycho out there.

197
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,180
You make yourself harder to find.

198
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,987
Delete social media,
tape over your phone camera,

199
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,096
disable GPS.

200
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,130
Yes, thank you very much,
Edward Snowden.

201
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,282
Actually, your mother just interrogated me
about Tara's attempted murder,

202
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,710
which was very fun.

203
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,060
I'm sure she's asking everybody.
I mean, Ghostface is back.

204
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,698
The press still isn't saying Ghostface.

205
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,157
My mom doesn't want
to cause a panic.

206
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,008
It'll get out by the second
or third killing.

207
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,962
Jesus, Mindy, there wasn't
a first killing Tara's alive.

208
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,964
- Mmm. I mean, she could still die.
- What the fuck?

209
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,271
Or the killer
could come back for her.

210
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:53,450
Fuck! Mindy, come on.

211
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,322
I'm just telling you, arm up, okay?

212
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,520
Pepper spray, check.
Taser, check.

213
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,937
Girlfriend repellent, check.

214
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:01,620
Nice. Thank you.

215
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,940
Holy shit.
Is that... Vince?

216
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,440
Wait. The creep you hooked up
with last summer?

217
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,524
Yeah. He worked
with me and Tara.

218
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:12,610
He worked with Tara?

219
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,520
He's been stalking my Instagram
the last couple weeks,

220
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:17,910
posting the creepiest shit.

221
00:15:18,804 --> 00:15:20,926
Probably time to introduce him
to Hobbs and Shaw.

222
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,270
Maybe not the best idea
to incite violence

223
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:25,073
right in front of the sheriff.

224
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,932
Looks like he's leaving.

225
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,947
Thanks anyway, boys.

226
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:30,510
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

227
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,430
Hmm. Tara says
she fought back hard.

228
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:34,780
You've got bruises.

229
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,270
From football practice.

230
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,273
Oh, sure.

231
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:38,767
Tara's awake. She just texted.

232
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:41,470
I'm going to the hospital.
You guys coming?

233
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,576
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

234
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:46,140
Oh, uh... I can't,
but I'll meet you guys later.

235
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,610
All right.

236
00:15:57,437 --> 00:15:58,730
I've actually never seen <i>Stab.</i>

237
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,310
You've never seen <i>Stab?</i>

238
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:03,401
Not even the one that
came out last year?

239
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,292
I've never seen
<i>Gone with the Wind</i> either,

240
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,010
but I don't consider it, like,
a huge hole in my cinematic education.

241
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,440
Most of the <i>Stab</i> movies are based
on things that happened here.

242
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,510
Define "things."

243
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,010
Things like...

244
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,328
a guy named Billy Loomis
and his friend

245
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,183
carved up a bunch
of high-school kids

246
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,154
while wearing this
Halloween ghost mask.

247
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:24,710
You mean like in <i>Halloween?</i>

248
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:27,870
- No. Not like in <i>Halloween.</i>
- Oh.

249
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,282
- Sounds a lot like <i>Halloween.</i>
- All right, it's a little like <i>Halloween.</i>

250
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:33,230
Okay.

251
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,270
And every decade or so,
some idiot gets the bright idea

252
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,372
to put on the mask, kill his friends,
and get famous too.

253
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,610
The last time it happened
was in 2011.

254
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,431
And we came here voluntarily?

255
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,740
Well, I got to make sure
Tara's okay.

256
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,710
Right. Yes, of course.

257
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,117
And I got to make sure we don't
get sliced up by some lunatic

258
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,562
who saw <i>Friday the 13th</i> and
thought, "You know what?

259
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:57,010
That Jason guy,
he's got some pretty solid ideas."

260
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,682
Can I just ask you
one question, though?

261
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:01,580
Yeah.

262
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,300
Do you have any idea why

263
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,570
someone wearing that mask
would want to kill your sister?

264
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
No.

265
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,710
How are you feeling?

266
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,924
You came.

267
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:34,602
Of course I came.

268
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,002
This is my boyfriend, Richie.

269
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:39,570
It's so nice to meet you
I'm so sorry if I'm intruding.

270
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,510
Nice to meet you, too.

271
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,090
Hi.

272
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,910
- Thank you for calling.
- Of course.

273
00:17:49,414 --> 00:17:51,540
Look at your hair!
I like it.

274
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,740
These are Chad and Mindy,
the twins. And Wes.

275
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,115
I used to babysit them all.

276
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:59,310
Which is always how I like
to be introduced.

277
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:02,710
And Amber. Hey!

278
00:18:03,463 --> 00:18:05,640
Hi. Nice to see you.

279
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,559
Hi, I'm Richie.

280
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,830
Hi.

281
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:09,920
Where's Mom?

282
00:18:09,997 --> 00:18:11,570
She's stuck
at a conference in London.

283
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:12,860
She called me earlier.

284
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:14,770
Yeah, for all of ten minutes.

285
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,210
Look, guys. Tara's really tired.

286
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,028
Maybe we should
just give her some space.

287
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,117
Yeah.

288
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:22,820
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

289
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,170
Not you, Sam.

290
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,710
I want you to stay.

291
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,482
Okay.

292
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,540
- But them rest.
- Yeah.

293
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,440
If it's okay with you,
I could sleep here tonight.

294
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:39,891
I'd really like that.

295
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,259
Okay.

296
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:43,700
- Do you have your extra inhaler?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

297
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,810
Okay.

298
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:48,850
Bye.

299
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,680
- Okay, I'll just be right outside.
- Thank you.

300
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:51,812
Bye.

301
00:19:01,414 --> 00:19:04,038
- Sam, I was so scared.
- I know.

302
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:06,840
It's okay.

303
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,973
<i>So what is she like,
the sister?</i>

304
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,950
Sam?
Oh, Sam is so cool.

305
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,755
You only say that
because she let you

306
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,530
wear Pokemon onesies
to bed for a year.

307
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,627
That's true.
That's a true statement.

308
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,298
No, trust me, Sam is not cool.

309
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,637
Her dad left her mom, right?

310
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,728
Walks right out
when Tara's eight, Sam's 13.

311
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,429
Sam started acting out,
getting in trouble with the cops.

312
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,840
And then, on Sam's 18th birthday,
she leaves.

313
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,736
Ghosts them all.

314
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,773
Maybe Sam's changed.

315
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,656
I just don't want
to see Tara hurt again.

316
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,011
So what, you're protecting Tara
from her own sister now?

317
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,400
Well, someone has to.

318
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:47,990
Okay, so no guys
are good enough for her,

319
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,690
and now her family's
off-limits, too?

320
00:19:49,784 --> 00:19:51,580
Mmm, motive.

321
00:19:51,686 --> 00:19:53,430
"If I can't have her,
no one can."

322
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,400
What?

323
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,240
We all know you have
a crush on Tara.

324
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,627
Okay Come on, Mindy.

325
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,670
But we're all suspects.

326
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,010
Except maybe Liv.

327
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,910
Thank you.

328
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,360
You're way too boring
to be a psycho.

329
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,507
Yo, Liv.

330
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:10,048
You want a real drink?

331
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:12,740
Or are you happy sitting
at this kids' table?

332
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,846
Listen up,
Uglier Michael Myers.

333
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:16,560
It was a summer fling.
It meant nothing.

334
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,802
Was I talking to you?

335
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:19,030
I don't care who you're talking to.

336
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,570
- Liv, let's go.
- Don't talk to her!

337
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,374
- I don't want to hear your voice.
- Shut your mouth.

338
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,770
- Better shut the fuck up!
- Hey!

339
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,692
Get out of here
or I'm calling the cops.

340
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,692
Go!

341
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,950
- I'll see you soon, sweetheart.
- Hey, man, fuck you.

342
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,170
You kids, too! Let's go!

343
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,740
Did you see that shit?

344
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,910
Fuck this bar, man.

345
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,440
Fuck you.

346
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,270
Fuck it!

347
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,240
What the fuck?

348
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,610
What the fuck?

349
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,710
Is that you, pretty boy? Huh?

350
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,370
Get out of my fucking car!

351
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,510
Hey.

352
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,840
- You okay?
- Yeah.

353
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:17,040
Just a bad dream.

354
00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:19,158
What are you watching?

355
00:22:19,443 --> 00:22:21,840
Oh, <i>Stab</i> is on Netflix.

356
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:26,010
What? I want to be prepared.

357
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,920
I got to go
find something to eat.

358
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,020
Yeah, okay.

359
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,820
How you doing, Sam?

360
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,955
Antipsychotics aren't working
as well as they used to, are they?

361
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,910
Fuck you.

362
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:07,210
You can't run
from who you are, Sam.

363
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,140
I'm just trying to help.

364
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,340
Hey, when are you gonna tell her
why all this is happening?

365
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,610
Hello.

366
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,810
<i>Hello, Samantha.</i>

367
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,900
Who is this?

368
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:40,680
<i>Someone who knows
your little family secret.</i>

369
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,930
You're the fuck
who hurt my sister?

370
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,420
<i>Oh, she's not
the only one I'm gonna hurt.</i>

371
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:50,930
<i>I had to get you to come
back here somehow, didn't I?</i>

372
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:54,080
You want to fuck with me,
asshole?

373
00:23:54,496 --> 00:23:55,550
I'm right here.

374
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,705
Come and get me.

375
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,164
<i>With pleasure.</i>

376
00:24:13,514 --> 00:24:14,580
Help!

377
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,091
Help! Help!

378
00:24:25,254 --> 00:24:27,840
Somebody help me!
He's trying to kill me!

379
00:24:28,729 --> 00:24:30,620
What's going on?
You're okay.

380
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,610
Somebody tried to kill me
in the break room!

381
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,410
I've got a body
outside a bar on Main,

382
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,210
and then you get attacked here.

383
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,164
You said the call came
from Amber's number?

384
00:24:50,244 --> 00:24:53,210
So? We know he cloned my phone
before when he attacked Tara.

385
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,827
Or, and I'm just
spit-balling here...

386
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,240
you're the killer.

387
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,094
And where were you
when all this happened?

388
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,987
I was...
watching Netflix.

389
00:25:03,094 --> 00:25:05,300
Yeah. Super-solid alibi, bro.

390
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:06,580
So where were you?

391
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,839
I was questioning Amber and
her friends at the sheriff's station.

392
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,648
Yeah, I came as soon as I heard.

393
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,406
But, you know,
the Netflix alibi is good, too.

394
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:13,480
Both of you, stop it.

395
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,476
You're gonna put more cops
on her room, right?

396
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,789
Yes.

397
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:18,880
And I can move you
to a private floor.

398
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,014
Deputy Vinson knows
what he's doing, you'll be safe.

399
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,410
Like we've been so far?

400
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,950
Samantha, let's step outside.

401
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:32,180
Nice to see you, Deputy Hicks.

402
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,450
So many fun memories.

403
00:25:34,614 --> 00:25:35,640
It's "Sheriff" Hicks.

404
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,132
I remember you, too...

405
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:40,001
and all the trouble you used
to cause your family.

406
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,900
Your presence here is not helping.

407
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,957
So maybe when
the sun comes up,

408
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,522
you and your boyfriend
can hit the road

409
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,650
and leave it to people who
actually care about this community.

410
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,680
Well, she remains a delight.

411
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,852
Are you okay?

412
00:26:06,337 --> 00:26:08,366
Um, would you mind
giving us a second?

413
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:09,490
I need to talk to Tara.

414
00:26:10,073 --> 00:26:11,390
Come on, Netflix.
Let's go.

415
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,680
Do you remember
when Dad left?

416
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,280
Parts, sure.

417
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,400
I was eight. I don't know what
that has to do with anything.

418
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,987
It has to do with it.

419
00:26:43,631 --> 00:26:44,950
Do you remember how...

420
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,850
Mom used to keep
those boxes up in the attic?

421
00:26:49,383 --> 00:26:50,980
Well, I was up there once,

422
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,880
when I was 13,
looking for Christmas presents.

423
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:58,199
And I found these old diaries
that she kept from high school.

424
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,953
- Sam, what is...
- Please.

425
00:27:00,324 --> 00:27:01,780
I just... I have to do this.

426
00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:04,250
So, I found these old diaries.

427
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,780
And I knew it was wrong,
but I read some anyway

428
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,039
because Mom got pregnant
with me in high school,

429
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,722
and I thought it
could be cool to find out,

430
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,494
how she and Dad got together.

431
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,080
How romantic it
must have been.

432
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,650
So I read some.

433
00:27:19,395 --> 00:27:21,050
Only it wasn't romantic.

434
00:27:23,137 --> 00:27:24,830
Mom was dating Dad, but...

435
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,610
She was in love
with this other guy...

436
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,780
and he got her pregnant.

437
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,000
She told Dad it was his,

438
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:34,334
and that's why
he proposed senior year.

439
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,730
Sam, what are you talking about?

440
00:27:35,802 --> 00:27:37,880
And I'm sitting there,
in this attic.

441
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,932
And I'm 13...

442
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,210
and I just found out
my dad isn't my dad.

443
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:49,650
So, I go find Mom in her bedroom,
and I'm screaming at her

444
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,780
and showing this diary
in her face,

445
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,850
and I didn't even realize...

446
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,400
that Dad was standing
right behind me.

447
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:01,050
He didn't know.

448
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,010
He found out right then
from me.

449
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:11,410
He left that night.

450
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,210
I'm the reason he left.

451
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:15,350
No.

452
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,058
- No, Sam...
- Mom never forgive me.

453
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,810
Then she made me promise never to
tell you because you were so young.

454
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,452
And that's why I changed

455
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:29,910
and I got distant
and weird with you.

456
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,564
And I went out
and I started doing

457
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,079
every drug that I
could get my hands on,

458
00:28:37,303 --> 00:28:39,910
until I couldn't take it anymore
and I left town.

459
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,258
I just couldn't be
around you anymore, Tara.

460
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,006
Not only because I destroyed
our family that night,

461
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:47,407
but because...

462
00:28:47,654 --> 00:28:50,580
those diaries told me
who my real father was...

463
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:55,870
It was Billy Loomis.

464
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,252
And somebody knows,

465
00:28:58,385 --> 00:28:59,985
and I think
that's why you got hurt.

466
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,650
And I'm so fucking sorry that I
never told you and then I run away.

467
00:29:03,928 --> 00:29:05,310
- I'm so sorry.
- Get out.

468
00:29:05,469 --> 00:29:06,879
Tara.

469
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,650
You're gone for five years...

470
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,850
Five whole years.

471
00:29:10,964 --> 00:29:12,820
And then I get stabbed
and you want to come back

472
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,110
and drop all this shit on me?

473
00:29:14,198 --> 00:29:15,810
No, I swear.
I thought I was protecting you.

474
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,500
Protecting me from what?

475
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:21,010
The truth?

476
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,560
No, no, I...

477
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,893
- Sam.
- Please, Tara.

478
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,829
Sam, I need you
to get the fuck out.

479
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:28,920
I'm so sorry.

480
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,310
- Sam.
- Please.

481
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,150
Get the fuck out!

482
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,920
Hey, hey, hey.

483
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,021
It's okay, it's me.

484
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,580
Were you listening at the door?

485
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,600
No, no, of course not.

486
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,480
Okay, yeah,
I was listening at the door.

487
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,510
It doesn't freak you out...

488
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,810
that my real father
was a serial killer?

489
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,480
I mean...

490
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,210
Yeah.

491
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,149
A great deal, yeah.

492
00:30:14,431 --> 00:30:17,144
Okay, well, then go.
I get it.

493
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,648
I just got to stay
and figure it out.

494
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,149
I'm not leaving you here, Sam.

495
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,910
You know that part
in horror movies,

496
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:27,080
where you want to yell
at the characters to be smart

497
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,610
and get the fuck out?

498
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,950
This is that part, Richie.

499
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,180
You should get the fuck out.

500
00:30:38,781 --> 00:30:39,800
But I'm staying.

501
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:44,471
I love you.

502
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,511
You're such a dumbass.

503
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,324
I'm such a dumbass.

504
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,816
So...

505
00:30:55,015 --> 00:30:56,650
Your sister won't talk to you.

506
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,610
The police aren't gonna help.

507
00:31:00,004 --> 00:31:01,310
What's our next move?

508
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,910
We go talk to an expert.

509
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,980
<i>...a few temperatures here.
Tuesday, Wednesday in the mid-50s,</i>

510
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,307
<i>and then finally we'll see those
mid-60s returning into next week.</i>

511
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,442
<i>Just one night after a local teen
was attacked in her home</i>

512
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,827
<i>by an assailant
wearing a Ghostface costume,</i>

513
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,625
<i>Sheriff Judy Hicks has now confirmed</i>

514
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,850
<i>two more late-night attacks
that have left Woodsboro reeling.</i>

515
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,567
<i>The first victim, Vincent Schneider,</i>

516
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:30,138
<i>was found dead behind
the Corner Pocket Pool Hall.</i>

517
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,090
<i>A second victim, as yet unnamed,</i>

518
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,540
<i>was attacked inside
Woodsboro General Hospital,</i>

519
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,410
<i>but she escaped without injuries.</i>

520
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,493
<i>Needless to say,
Woodsboro is on high alert today...</i>

521
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,580
<i>Live from Studio 1-A
in Rockefeller Plaza...</i>

522
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,665
<i>Good morning,
I'm Gale Weathers.</i>

523
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:47,800
<i>Before we dive in,
I want to tell you a little story</i>

524
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,111
<i>that happened on the way
to the studio this morning.</i>

525
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:53,510
<i>I stopped to get a bacon,
egg and cheese at a bodega,</i>

526
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:55,270
<i>already a quintessentially New York...</i>

527
00:31:55,365 --> 00:31:56,710
Go away!

528
00:31:56,903 --> 00:31:58,750
Sorry to bother you, Mr Riley!

529
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:01,515
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

530
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,374
I don't give interviews.

531
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,380
We're not looking
for an interview.

532
00:32:07,783 --> 00:32:09,910
Give me one good reason
why I should talk to you?

533
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,452
I'm Billy Loomis's daughter.

534
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,080
That's a terrible reason
for me to talk to you.

535
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:18,210
My name is Samantha Carpenter.

536
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:21,050
I was attacked last night
at the hospital.

537
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:24,380
The night before that,
my sister was stabbed seven times.

538
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,006
I know you know
what that's like.

539
00:32:26,991 --> 00:32:28,980
I'm just trying to protect my family.

540
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,980
Five minutes.
That's all I'm asking.

541
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,713
I'll give you two minutes.

542
00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:38,310
I'm missing a show I like.

543
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,625
<i>...bangs again,
stage an intervention.</i>

544
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,882
Gale Weathers.

545
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:44,910
- Weren't you two, um...
- Yeah.

546
00:32:53,997 --> 00:32:55,135
Who's he?

547
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,450
Oh, this is Richie,
my boyfriend.

548
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,670
How long have you known him?

549
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,410
Six months?

550
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:02,680
Did he know who your dad was
when you met?

551
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,340
Express any interest
in Woodsboro

552
00:33:05,432 --> 00:33:07,400
or the Ghostface killings?

553
00:33:07,543 --> 00:33:09,280
What the hell are you
talking about?

554
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:12,210
Your killer's obsessed
with the <i>Stab</i> movies, right?

555
00:33:12,343 --> 00:33:16,650
Well, there are certain rules
to surviving a <i>Stab</i> movie.

556
00:33:17,825 --> 00:33:19,080
Believe me, I know.

557
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,623
Rule number one:

558
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,153
Never trust the love interest.

559
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,300
They seem sweet,
caring, supportive.

560
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,185
Then welcome to act 3,
where they're trying to rip your head off.

561
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,928
I was with Sam in Modesto
when Tara was attacked.

562
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,962
And let me guess,
you were just in the other room,

563
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:37,292
conveniently unaccounted for when
she was attacked at the hospital.

564
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,780
Okay, do I have to take this from
shitty Sam Elliott over here, or what?

565
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,770
Rule number two:

566
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:47,450
The killer's motive is always
connected to something in the past.

567
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,180
I'm related to Billy.

568
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:52,980
Right, but then why kill
that random Vince guy?

569
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,780
That's for you to figure out.

570
00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:57,955
And rule number three,
and this is the most important rule:

571
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:03,030
The first victim always has a
friend group that the killer is a part of.

572
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,301
Does your sister have a
close-knit group of friends?

573
00:34:06,926 --> 00:34:08,150
Yeah.

574
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,350
She does.

575
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:12,346
Then look for the killer there.

576
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,000
If you can find out,
why they're doing this,

577
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,720
you can figure out who's next.

578
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:19,140
So help us.

579
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,985
Help us figure out
who is behind this.

580
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,850
You kidding me?
I've been stabbed nine times.

581
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,440
I've got permanent nerve damage
and a fun little limp.

582
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,080
You think I want to do that again?

583
00:34:29,688 --> 00:34:33,080
You just said it always goes
back to the past, right?

584
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,150
So if I'm in danger...

585
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,780
that means you're in danger.

586
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:42,070
Come on.

587
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,880
Let's do this together.

588
00:34:48,214 --> 00:34:49,216
Your time's up.

589
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,980
Jesus!

590
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:54,380
Yeah, he's way more fun
in the movies.

591
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,753
Okay, what's next?

592
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
The friends.

593
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,020
<i>Thanks so much for that, Kevin.</i>

594
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:05,772
<i>Coming up after
our local weather,</i>

595
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,910
<i>the pros and cons of
reuniting with old friends.</i>

596
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,580
Hello?

597
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,810
<i>Hey, Sid, it's me.</i>

598
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,538
Dewey?

599
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,711
Oh, my God.
How long has it been?

600
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:48,397
I'm just trying to get a run in
before I take the girls to school.

601
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,543
How are you?

602
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:51,410
I'm good, really good.

603
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,060
How are you?
How's Mark?

604
00:35:53,147 --> 00:35:54,330
I think I'll keep him.

605
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,817
How are things
in the sheriff's business?

606
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,500
Uh, they're...

607
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:02,000
- They're fine. But, Sid...
- <i>Have you talked to Gale lately?</i>

608
00:36:03,818 --> 00:36:05,670
No. Not in a couple years.

609
00:36:06,526 --> 00:36:08,630
I know things didn't end well
with you guys, but...

610
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,138
Sid...

611
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:11,680
It's happening again.

612
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:17,290
What are you talking about?

613
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,670
<i>Some idiot in a Ghostface mask.</i>

614
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,766
<i>Three attacks so far.
One dead.</i>

615
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,530
Something about this one
just feels different.

616
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,000
Are you okay?

617
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,227
<i>I'm fine, you know me.</i>

618
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,570
Yeah.

619
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,922
I do. That's why I'm asking.

620
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,800
I'm fine.

621
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,473
I just...

622
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,030
want you to be safe up there
Do you have a gun?

623
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,240
I'm Sidney fucking Prescott.

624
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,492
Of course, I have a gun.

625
00:36:46,793 --> 00:36:48,101
Good. That's good.

626
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:50,170
Does Gale know?

627
00:36:50,282 --> 00:36:51,900
No, she's my next call.

628
00:36:52,728 --> 00:36:54,141
But, Sid, promise me:

629
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,990
<i>No matter what you hear
or what you see on the news,</i>

630
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,370
<i>don't come here.</i>

631
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,536
No offense, Dewey.

632
00:36:59,616 --> 00:37:01,715
I have no intention of ever
setting foot in that town again.

633
00:37:02,515 --> 00:37:03,450
Good.

634
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,800
Dewey...

635
00:37:06,587 --> 00:37:09,530
<i>whoever this killer's after,
I'm glad they have you to protect them.</i>

636
00:37:11,513 --> 00:37:12,550
But...

637
00:37:13,443 --> 00:37:14,974
you be safe, okay?

638
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,060
Will do.

639
00:37:17,898 --> 00:37:19,190
<i>It's good to hear your voice.</i>

640
00:37:20,465 --> 00:37:21,468
You, too, Sid.

641
00:37:25,063 --> 00:37:27,529
Come on.
Get it together, Dewey.

642
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,220
Probably shouldn't
have sent the smiley face.

643
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:36,260
Holy shit. He came.

644
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,317
I've decided to temporarily
assist you in your investigation.

645
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,560
Thank you.

646
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,641
Look, just because
that guy showered

647
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,473
doesn't mean
he should have a gun.

648
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,393
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

649
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,964
How do you know so much
about the <i>Stab</i> movies?

650
00:38:59,597 --> 00:39:00,960
Runs in her family.

651
00:39:01,735 --> 00:39:02,960
Randy was our uncle.

652
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,260
RIP.

653
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,463
You said to bring everybody.

654
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:10,113
Hey.

655
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:14,141
Ooh, suspects!

656
00:39:15,129 --> 00:39:17,263
My brother would be so proud.

657
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,460
Hey, Martha.

658
00:39:19,996 --> 00:39:22,363
Dewey! Hi!

659
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:23,829
You look...

660
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:27,640
Yeah.

661
00:39:27,749 --> 00:39:28,740
How's the wife?

662
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:30,620
Okay. Mom, we're good.
Thank you.

663
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,090
All right, kids, have fun.

664
00:39:36,496 --> 00:39:38,996
I asked Mindy to call
everybody here, because...

665
00:39:41,418 --> 00:39:43,220
there's something
I have to tell you.

666
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,814
So let me get this straight.

667
00:39:45,909 --> 00:39:48,560
You're saying that you're
the daughter of Billy Loomis,

668
00:39:48,663 --> 00:39:50,863
and, what, that one
of us is the killer?

669
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:53,363
The killer told me
he knew my secret.

670
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,220
He attacked Tara
to lure me back here.

671
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,280
But then why,

672
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,894
immediately go and murder some
douche-nozzle that was stalking Liv?

673
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,492
And why does it have
to be one of us?

674
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,031
What about Deputy Dewey here?

675
00:40:04,122 --> 00:40:05,520
Maybe he's the killer.

676
00:40:06,249 --> 00:40:07,170
No offense.

677
00:40:07,234 --> 00:40:09,520
None taken,
but what's my motive?

678
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,631
You got stabbed a billion times,

679
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,682
got dumped by your famous wife
and crawled into a bottle.

680
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,043
I think it's safe to say
you're on the suspect list.

681
00:40:17,132 --> 00:40:18,720
Well, maybe you're the killer.

682
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:21,560
Because that cut deep.

683
00:40:22,229 --> 00:40:24,129
That douche-nozzle
is connected.

684
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,060
I googled him.
His mom is Leslie Macher.

685
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:30,190
- Stu Macher's sister.
- Who's Stu Macher?

686
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:32,463
He's Billy Loomis's accomplice.

687
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,129
A real loony tune.

688
00:40:34,229 --> 00:40:35,563
Okay. Okay.

689
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:40,540
So the first three attacks are all on
people related to the original killers.

690
00:40:40,652 --> 00:40:42,460
Oh, my God.
He's making a requel!

691
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,290
A what?

692
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:46,720
Or a legacyquel.
Fans are torn on the terminology.

693
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:48,396
Please speak English.

694
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,206
Remember the <i>Stab</i> movie
that came out last year?

695
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,033
Oh, yeah!

696
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,940
The one the <i>Knives Out</i>
guy directed?

697
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:54,650
I actually really liked that one.

698
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:56,370
Of course you did.
You have terrible taste.

699
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,460
I hate you.

700
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,650
The point is, the hard-core
<i>Stab</i> fans hated it.

701
00:41:00,763 --> 00:41:02,060
You go on 4chan and Dreadit,

702
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,791
all they're talking about is how <i>Stab 8</i>
pissed on their childhoods.

703
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,430
How they crammed in social
commentary just to elevate it.

704
00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:08,890
How the main character's a Mary Sue.

705
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,760
- What's a Mary Sue?
- You really don't want to know.

706
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,770
What's wrong with elevated horror?

707
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,020
I mean,
Jordan Peele fucking rules.

708
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,537
Uh, obviously,
but that's not <i>Stab.</i>

709
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,120
Real <i>Stab</i> movies are
meta slasher whodunits, full stop.

710
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,751
- Come on, it's just a movie.
- No, it's not.

711
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,114
To some people, the original is
their favorite thing in the world.

712
00:41:28,324 --> 00:41:30,560
The movie that made them
love horror.

713
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,412
That Mom or Dad showed them
when they were ten

714
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,962
that bonded them together.

715
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,150
And God help anyone,

716
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,444
who slightly fucks with
that special memory.

717
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,559
Who makes a movie
they think disrespects it.

718
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:43,930
It sounds like our killer is
writing his own version of <i>Stab 8,</i>

719
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,960
but doing it as a requel.

720
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,629
Which is?

721
00:41:48,747 --> 00:41:51,420
See, you can't just reboot a
franchise from scratch anymore.

722
00:41:51,496 --> 00:41:52,829
The fans won't stand for it.

723
00:41:52,896 --> 00:41:55,529
<i>Black Christmas,
Child's Play, Flatliners...</i>

724
00:41:55,629 --> 00:41:56,996
That shit doesn't work.

725
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,528
But you can't just do
a straight sequel, either.

726
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,181
You got to build something new.

727
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,090
But not too new, or
the Internet goes bug-fucking nuts.

728
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,317
It has to be part of
an ongoing story line,

729
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,363
even if the story shouldn't have
been ongoing in the first place.

730
00:42:09,463 --> 00:42:11,196
New main characters, yes,

731
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:14,961
but supported by and
related to legacy characters.

732
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,044
Not quite a reboot,
not quite a sequel.

733
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,700
Like the new <i>Halloween, Saw,</i>

734
00:42:18,793 --> 00:42:20,780
<i>Terminator, Jurassic
Park, Ghostbusters...</i>

735
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,138
fuck, even <i>Star Wars!</i>

736
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,202
It always, always goes back
to the original!

737
00:42:26,396 --> 00:42:30,696
Are you telling me that I'm caught
in the middle of fan-fucking-fiction?

738
00:42:31,345 --> 00:42:34,360
Not just in the middle, Sam.

739
00:42:35,227 --> 00:42:36,460
You're the star.

740
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,776
So, not to put too fine
a point on it,

741
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,360
but, according to requel rules...

742
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,393
Who's next?

743
00:42:48,854 --> 00:42:50,120
Going by the pattern.

744
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,677
Whoever it is has to be connected
to someone that came before.

745
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,701
I'm starting to
regret coming here.

746
00:43:00,807 --> 00:43:02,340
Jesus, my mom was
a character in one of them.

747
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,976
No one cares about
the shitty inferior sequels, Wes.

748
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,187
You're safe,

749
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,656
with Randy as our uncle, though,
you and I are probably screwed.

750
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,745
Wait. What?

751
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:10,787
Or you're the killer,

752
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,560
and this whole elaborate monologue
is just to cover your tracks.

753
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,061
I think it's pretty clear,
who the killer is at this point.

754
00:43:18,252 --> 00:43:19,259
Who?

755
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,460
You.

756
00:43:21,615 --> 00:43:22,683
What...

757
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,503
It makes perfect requel sense.

758
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,866
- That actually does make a lot of sense.
- Yeah.

759
00:43:31,738 --> 00:43:32,900
Fuck this.

760
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,030
- Meet you back at the motel.
- Sam, wait.

761
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,230
Sam, wait.

762
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,800
The first fucking rule of
these movies is don't split up!

763
00:43:47,947 --> 00:43:49,630
The nerve of that girl, right?

764
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:54,130
I'm really not in the mood
right now.

765
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,376
Sam, Sam, Sam.

766
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,547
There is a killer on the loose.

767
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,800
He's threatening you.
He's threatening your sister.

768
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,430
Are you gonna run away from
who you are like you always do,

769
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,856
or are you gonna use it?

770
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,341
I'm not like you.

771
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,587
Really?

772
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,271
Then how else
are you gonna survive?

773
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,712
I say accept who you are.

774
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,200
Let's get out there,
find out who's doing this,

775
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,629
and cut some fucking throats!

776
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:15,730
No!

777
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,130
And extra edamame. Please.

778
00:44:27,395 --> 00:44:29,700
Thank you.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

779
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,330
Bye.

780
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,160
That you, tiger?

781
00:45:19,128 --> 00:45:20,930
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus!

782
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:26,152
Are you being safe
out there, honey?

783
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:29,227
To the point that all
my friends mock me, yes.

784
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:30,490
Good boy.

785
00:45:30,823 --> 00:45:31,821
What's for dinner?

786
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,114
Sushi. I was just leaving
to pick it up.

787
00:45:34,323 --> 00:45:35,960
Oh. Why don't you
just Postmates it?

788
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,060
Oh, it gets all smooshy
by the time it's here.

789
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,460
I know you hate that.

790
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,960
- Go shower. I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

791
00:45:43,098 --> 00:45:45,230
- Can you put this away for me?
- Yes.

792
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:48,328
Okay.

793
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,250
- Love you.
- Love you.

794
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:51,930
- Lock the door.
- I will.

795
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:31,010
Sheriff Hicks.

796
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,620
<i>Hello, Sheriff Judy.</i>

797
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,604
Who is this?

798
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,740
<i>I think you know.</i>

799
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:40,560
<i>I'm a fan of scary movies.
And knives.</i>

800
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,540
<i>What's your favorite
scary movie?</i>

801
00:46:44,404 --> 00:46:46,440
I prefer animated films
and musicals.

802
00:46:47,098 --> 00:46:48,540
Why are you doing this?

803
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,233
<i>I'll tell you all about it.</i>

804
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,200
<i>I'm calling to turn myself in.</i>

805
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,406
I think that's a great idea.

806
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,974
<i>We'll sit down at the station,</i>

807
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:59,050
<i>and I'll tell you about
the two people I've killed.</i>

808
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,770
You've only killed one person.

809
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,079
<i>By the time I see you,</i>

810
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,902
<i>I'll have gutted your baby boy.</i>

811
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,242
No.

812
00:47:07,795 --> 00:47:09,170
Whoa.

813
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,840
Fuck you!

814
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,131
Pick up, Wes!

815
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,600
This is Sheriff Hicks.

816
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,625
I need units to converge
on my house ASAP.

817
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,780
<i>Copy that. We're on it.</i>

818
00:47:36,511 --> 00:47:38,280
<i>Can't get him
on the phone, can you?</i>

819
00:47:38,378 --> 00:47:39,970
<i>He must be busy.</i>

820
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:42,061
How do I know
you're anywhere near him?

821
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,400
<i>Ever seen the movie Psycho?</i>

822
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,840
Please...

823
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,219
don't hurt my boy.

824
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,690
<i>Why not?</i>

825
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,670
- He's a good kid.
- <i>Is he, now?</i>

826
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:06,100
He never hurt anyone.

827
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:08,320
<i>That's not enough.</i>

828
00:48:08,503 --> 00:48:10,870
Please! I'll do anything!

829
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,670
<i>You're not gonna
make it in time, Sheriff Judy.</i>

830
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,800
Wes!

831
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,400
I'm coming!

832
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:37,376
Wes!

833
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,870
Help!

834
00:48:49,101 --> 00:48:50,540
Help!

835
00:50:21,128 --> 00:50:22,122
Okay.

836
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:22,970
Mom?

837
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,940
Mom?

838
00:52:33,513 --> 00:52:35,900
Fuck... you!

839
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:23,429
Miss, you can't be here.

840
00:53:23,532 --> 00:53:24,672
- What?
- You can't be here.

841
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,332
No, I'm sorry.
I know her son.

842
00:53:26,442 --> 00:53:28,540
- Her son, Wes. Is he...
- I'm sorry.

843
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:37,640
I'm sorry.

844
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:50,460
Excuse me.

845
00:53:53,669 --> 00:53:54,660
Oh, my God.

846
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,301
You're...

847
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:58,998
Well, you're you.

848
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:00,510
Last time I checked.

849
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,454
Are you okay? You seem like
you're having a bit of a moment.

850
00:54:04,564 --> 00:54:05,840
Did you know the sheriff?

851
00:54:06,888 --> 00:54:07,940
Sort of.

852
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,610
She didn't like me very much.

853
00:54:11,433 --> 00:54:12,712
She didn't like me either.

854
00:54:13,814 --> 00:54:16,210
I'm Samantha.
Sam. Carpenter.

855
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,210
My sister and I were attacked.

856
00:54:18,746 --> 00:54:20,910
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

857
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:22,540
I'm Gale...

858
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,740
Riley.

859
00:54:29,204 --> 00:54:31,710
Weathers. I'm Gale Weathers.
Excuse me.

860
00:54:35,326 --> 00:54:36,380
- Gale?
- A text?

861
00:54:36,831 --> 00:54:38,779
You tell me
the killer is back in a text?

862
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:40,830
- Ow, that hurts.
- Good!

863
00:54:41,001 --> 00:54:43,280
- You were on the air.
- How do you know?

864
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,610
A hunch.

865
00:54:46,168 --> 00:54:48,480
You look good.
Are you still writing?

866
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,910
No time.

867
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:53,519
You were always happiest
when you were writing.

868
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:55,284
Well, sir, it's okay.
We're here with Gale.

869
00:54:55,374 --> 00:54:58,054
I'd give you a hand,
but I can't release anybody right now.

870
00:54:58,724 --> 00:55:00,520
Couldn't resist a good story,
could you?

871
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:01,776
Don't be an idiot, Dewey.

872
00:55:01,852 --> 00:55:03,860
I'm here because I
was worried about you.

873
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:05,510
Okay, yes.

874
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,549
My producers wanted me to cover this,
for obvious reasons...

875
00:55:09,071 --> 00:55:10,880
but 90% is because of you.

876
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,910
Well, I feel 90% better.

877
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,433
Don't be so sensitive.

878
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,619
Since when did you care
about my feelings?

879
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:19,040
Especially not in the last couple years.

880
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,747
All right, listen.
Let's not pretend.

881
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:22,149
I'm the one who ended things.

882
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,488
No one's pretending, Gale.

883
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,940
I remember what happened.

884
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,580
Why aren't you in uniform?

885
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,124
I retired.

886
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,580
Since when?

887
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:36,295
Since they asked me to.

888
00:55:37,764 --> 00:55:38,764
Oh, Dewey.

889
00:55:38,854 --> 00:55:40,440
I don't need your pity, Gale.

890
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,429
I made my choices.
So did you.

891
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,235
It was my turn.

892
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,810
It was a great opportunity.

893
00:55:47,296 --> 00:55:49,180
- You said you'd try.
- And I did.

894
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,509
For two whole months!

895
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,366
Listen, if you want
to make me feel worse

896
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:54,311
than I already do,
good luck.

897
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:57,140
The mornings aren't so bad,
'cause I get to see you.

898
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,080
Pretend I'm still back there
in New York.

899
00:56:01,368 --> 00:56:02,540
But then I remember...

900
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,846
that I couldn't hack it.

901
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,048
I left in the middle
of the night...

902
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,042
like a coward.

903
00:56:10,964 --> 00:56:12,710
Why wouldn't you
tell me that then?

904
00:56:13,757 --> 00:56:14,980
It would have mattered.

905
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,900
You are a lot of things, Dewey.

906
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:22,640
But you are not a coward.

907
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:24,709
You just...

908
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:26,645
You just were meant to be
in Woodsboro.

909
00:56:27,886 --> 00:56:28,850
And you weren't?

910
00:56:31,581 --> 00:56:33,880
Promise me, you'll leave
as soon as you can.

911
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,510
You know I can't promise that.

912
00:56:40,343 --> 00:56:41,910
I'm sorry about Judy.

913
00:56:42,976 --> 00:56:44,061
Yeah, me too.

914
00:56:46,484 --> 00:56:48,534
But she'll make a great chapter
in your next book.

915
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,060
<i>And don't even get me started</i>

916
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,470
<i>on Ghostface's
signature new weapon.</i>

917
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,056
<i>That shit is lit</i>.

918
00:56:57,193 --> 00:56:59,580
<i>And can we talk
about the title?</i> Stab?

919
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,220
<i>What, just like the original?</i>

920
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,610
<i>Just call it Stab 8.</i>

921
00:57:02,701 --> 00:57:05,558
<i>It's fucking Stab 8.
You're not fooling anyone.</i>

922
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,052
<i>It's such bullshit.</i>

923
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,640
<i>Where have you been?
Are you okay?</i>

924
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:09,749
Yeah, I'm fine.

925
00:57:09,854 --> 00:57:11,014
<i>Mindy girl wasn't kidding.</i>

926
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:13,092
<i>Stab 8</i> is not like the others.

927
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,160
I mean, no connection
to the other movies.

928
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,228
- No legacy characters at all.
- <i>Richie.</i>

929
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,757
If you ask me, this franchise goes
off the rails with number five.

930
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,004
<i>Richie, listen to me.</i>

931
00:57:21,128 --> 00:57:23,330
He killed two more people.

932
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:25,400
Wes and his mother.

933
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,790
<i>He killed the sheriff?</i>

934
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:28,204
<i>You can do that?</i>

935
00:57:28,301 --> 00:57:30,580
<i>I mean, are you okay?
Where are you?</i>

936
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,179
- I'll call you right back.
- <i>No, Sam...</i>

937
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,182
Who's at the hospital?

938
00:57:37,677 --> 00:57:39,380
Who's watching my sister?

939
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:41,380
I just heard about the sheriff.

940
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,280
They needed me here!

941
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,140
- Where are you going?
- My sister's in trouble!

942
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:51,297
...where Judy Hicks
has just been brutally murdered.

943
00:57:57,928 --> 00:57:59,104
What are you waiting for?

944
00:57:59,532 --> 00:58:00,539
Drive!

945
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,540
Come on. Let's go!

946
00:58:03,409 --> 00:58:05,360
- <i>Are the doors locked?</i>
- <i>Yeah, we should check.</i>

947
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,600
<i>Joey and Pacey, check the front door.
Jen and Cliff, get flashlights...</i>

948
00:58:11,872 --> 00:58:13,807
- <i>Hey! Where you going?</i>
- Hello?

949
00:58:13,941 --> 00:58:14,999
<i>You stay there.</i>

950
00:58:15,112 --> 00:58:16,944
<i>No, I'm coming with you.</i>

951
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,170
<i>Okay.</i>

952
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:20,170
<i>He's got you.</i>

953
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:21,270
Hello?

954
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,670
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

955
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:24,260
<i>Please. Quit tripping out.</i>

956
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,473
<i>This is just Dawson
up to his old tired tricks.</i>

957
00:58:26,576 --> 00:58:28,320
<i>There's no psychopath
in this house.</i>

958
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,141
<i>Yes, there is.
And you brought her.</i>

959
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,333
Fuck this.

960
00:58:43,452 --> 00:58:44,370
Fuck!

961
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,616
Oh!

962
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:36,960
Goddamn it!

963
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:39,180
Should you really be making
a phone call right now?

964
00:59:40,122 --> 00:59:40,973
Please, please.

965
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:09,606
Stop!

966
01:00:10,463 --> 01:00:12,902
You know we have to live
through this to help her, right?

967
01:00:13,002 --> 01:00:14,006
Just hold on.

968
01:01:00,652 --> 01:01:01,658
Holy shit.

969
01:01:16,862 --> 01:01:18,188
Goddamn it!

970
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,438
Richie?

971
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,650
What are you doing here?

972
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:23,008
Sam called. She said that...

973
01:01:23,418 --> 01:01:24,640
you were in trouble.

974
01:01:25,006 --> 01:01:26,967
- Did you hit me with the phone?
- Look out!

975
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,235
Richie!

976
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:11,960
- <i>Are you at the hospital?</i>
- Hello, Samantha.

977
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:12,930
No.

978
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:15,580
Richie can't come
to the phone right now.

979
01:02:16,477 --> 01:02:18,070
He's finding out
what happens to people

980
01:02:18,157 --> 01:02:21,430
who stick their noses in business
that doesn't concern them.

981
01:02:21,581 --> 01:02:22,780
<i>Please don't hurt him.</i>

982
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:25,021
I tell you what.
You can choose.

983
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:26,271
I'll only kill one.

984
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,690
<i>What? What? Tara!</i>

985
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,747
Who do you want to hear die?

986
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,471
<i>No, please. I'm begging you
Please don't hurt them.</i>

987
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,854
Really?
You can't save your own sister?

988
01:02:36,004 --> 01:02:38,138
All you have to do is say,
"Kill Richie."

989
01:02:38,238 --> 01:02:39,240
<i>No!</i>

990
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,103
<i>Tara! Don't touch her.</i>

991
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:44,328
<i>Please, please, please,
I'm begging you.</i>

992
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:45,936
Or say, "Kill Tara,"

993
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:49,700
and I'll make sure to hit all
the organs I missed last time.

994
01:02:49,884 --> 01:02:51,480
- <i>No!</i>
- Fuck you!

995
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:54,061
<i>I'm begging you.
Please don't hurt her.</i>

996
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,268
Last chance to save one.

997
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,460
Choose!

998
01:02:58,210 --> 01:02:59,710
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

999
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:01,452
You want to know why, Sam?

1000
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:03,760
Maybe it's because
you're a selfish bitch

1001
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,631
who can't even make
a decision to save

1002
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,444
the life of someone you love.

1003
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:11,666
Maybe you're too weak
for this franchise.

1004
01:03:12,633 --> 01:03:14,080
<i>Maybe you're right.</i>

1005
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:18,440
<i>Or maybe I'm just
stalling for time, fuckhead.</i>

1006
01:03:24,248 --> 01:03:25,460
- I'll get Richie.
- Tara!

1007
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,176
Oh, my God!

1008
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,349
Come on, Richie.

1009
01:03:32,317 --> 01:03:34,080
It's okay. I got you.

1010
01:03:36,305 --> 01:03:37,510
It's gonna be all right.

1011
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:40,541
Get the elevator!

1012
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,080
Not today.

1013
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:20,810
Richie.

1014
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:22,840
Let's get out of here.

1015
01:04:29,844 --> 01:04:30,945
Come on, hurry up.

1016
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,753
- The head.
- What?

1017
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,370
You have to shoot 'em in the head,
or they always come back.

1018
01:04:38,471 --> 01:04:40,410
Dewey!
Who gives a fuck?

1019
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,510
- I do.
- No! Dewey!

1020
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:24,780
Yes, today.

1021
01:05:46,571 --> 01:05:48,410
It's an honor.

1022
01:06:34,305 --> 01:06:35,340
No!

1023
01:06:36,054 --> 01:06:37,055
No!

1024
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:18,140
I'm sorry.

1025
01:07:21,315 --> 01:07:22,940
I didn't know him well, but...

1026
01:07:24,602 --> 01:07:25,604
he helped me.

1027
01:07:27,604 --> 01:07:28,675
That's what he did.

1028
01:07:29,783 --> 01:07:31,109
He helped people.

1029
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,110
I should've stopped him.

1030
01:07:35,867 --> 01:07:37,880
If you had,
my sister would be dead.

1031
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,600
Samantha, your sister's awake.

1032
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,310
Gale.

1033
01:08:03,147 --> 01:08:04,142
Sidney.

1034
01:08:07,311 --> 01:08:08,630
I came as soon as I heard.

1035
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:13,056
I'm so sorry.

1036
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:25,530
You shouldn't be here.

1037
01:08:25,654 --> 01:08:27,030
You shouldn't be here either.

1038
01:08:29,303 --> 01:08:31,580
- Mark and the kids are okay?
- Yeah, they're safe for now.

1039
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:34,260
I'm here to make sure of that.

1040
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,400
Come here.

1041
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:52,300
How you feeling?

1042
01:08:52,797 --> 01:08:53,848
Every time I get attacked,

1043
01:08:53,981 --> 01:08:55,850
they give me better painkillers.

1044
01:08:56,962 --> 01:08:58,260
So there's that.

1045
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:02,200
I'm sorry.

1046
01:09:02,515 --> 01:09:04,100
For what?
You saved my life.

1047
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,530
For not telling you sooner.

1048
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,030
For being the reason Dad left.

1049
01:09:13,372 --> 01:09:15,100
You're not the reason Dad left.

1050
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,884
You didn't choose where you
came from. Or who you came from.

1051
01:09:19,006 --> 01:09:20,300
I don't blame you for that.

1052
01:09:22,305 --> 01:09:24,300
I blame you for leaving me too.

1053
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:26,760
That's never gonna happen again.

1054
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:29,690
I know.

1055
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,798
But why didn't you
come to me back then?

1056
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:35,330
I could've helped.

1057
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:36,960
Because...

1058
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,830
I was scared.

1059
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,900
Of what?

1060
01:09:44,488 --> 01:09:47,460
I was scared that I would
turn out just like him.

1061
01:09:48,953 --> 01:09:50,400
So I ran.

1062
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:53,029
To protect you.

1063
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,290
From me.

1064
01:09:55,977 --> 01:09:56,977
Sam...

1065
01:09:58,229 --> 01:10:00,030
you could never be like him.

1066
01:10:07,147 --> 01:10:09,400
- You're so high right now.
- I'm so high right now.

1067
01:10:09,966 --> 01:10:11,400
I'm not even gonna lie.

1068
01:10:16,858 --> 01:10:17,894
I love you.

1069
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:19,900
I love you too.

1070
01:10:23,795 --> 01:10:24,960
So what do we do now?

1071
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:29,100
What nobody ever does
in these situations.

1072
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:33,254
We're gonna get the fuck
out of Woodsboro.

1073
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:41,630
- That's her?
- Yeah.

1074
01:10:45,303 --> 01:10:46,340
Samantha?

1075
01:10:48,903 --> 01:10:49,908
It's Sam.

1076
01:10:50,027 --> 01:10:51,530
- I'm...
- I know who you are.

1077
01:10:53,555 --> 01:10:55,000
I hope you're okay.

1078
01:10:56,027 --> 01:10:58,460
- Listen, I'm sorry...
- You're Billy's daughter.

1079
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,103
We'll bring the car around.

1080
01:11:05,791 --> 01:11:07,848
Yeah. I'm his daughter.

1081
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:10,336
I'm sorry if
that's weird for you.

1082
01:11:10,428 --> 01:11:12,100
No, no, it's...

1083
01:11:13,585 --> 01:11:16,267
I've been through this.
A lot.

1084
01:11:17,597 --> 01:11:18,670
You want to talk?

1085
01:11:19,673 --> 01:11:21,000
I appreciate it.

1086
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,300
And I'm...

1087
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,930
I'm really sorry about Dewey.

1088
01:11:26,797 --> 01:11:28,830
But I'm taking my sister away
from all this.

1089
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,642
I tried running too.

1090
01:11:34,168 --> 01:11:35,720
It doesn't work, it always follows.

1091
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:37,850
All due respect,
that's your life, not mine.

1092
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:40,360
- I'm not so sure about that.
- What do you want from me, lady?

1093
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:42,930
Hey! Watch your tone, new girl.

1094
01:11:43,204 --> 01:11:45,820
You know how they always say
it goes back to the original?

1095
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:47,162
Here's the original.

1096
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:48,766
I want your help.

1097
01:11:48,869 --> 01:11:50,630
Because you're wrong,
this is your life now.

1098
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,300
Which means whoever this is
will keep coming for you.

1099
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,740
- So?
- So I want you to help us kill him.

1100
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,957
You want me to help you and the host
of a morning show commit murder?

1101
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,122
- Correct.
- Yeah.

1102
01:12:02,187 --> 01:12:04,160
And I'm what in this scenario?

1103
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:07,132
The bait?
He helpless victim?

1104
01:12:07,258 --> 01:12:09,830
- If the shoe fits...
- You're not helpless, Sam.

1105
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:12,214
He killed your friend,
he killed ours.

1106
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:15,360
And I have kids, which means I
won't sleep until he's in the ground.

1107
01:12:17,181 --> 01:12:20,060
Look, I'm sorry about what
this has done to your lives.

1108
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,420
But no matter what you
or the killer or anyone says,

1109
01:12:23,524 --> 01:12:25,290
this isn't my story.

1110
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:26,560
All right!

1111
01:12:26,693 --> 01:12:28,395
Let's get the fuck out
of town, huh?

1112
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:31,400
Sorry.
That's my boyfriend, Richie.

1113
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,200
Nice to meet... We met.

1114
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,940
Sam, please get in the car so we
never have to see these people again.

1115
01:12:36,035 --> 01:12:38,560
- Sam...
- No. We're leaving.

1116
01:12:39,486 --> 01:12:41,166
That's the only way
I can protect Tara.

1117
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:44,560
Okay, good luck.

1118
01:12:47,901 --> 01:12:49,030
You too.

1119
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,633
Well, that went fucking horribly.

1120
01:12:55,722 --> 01:12:58,230
Don't worry, I have a plan.
She seems really tough.

1121
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:00,330
Honestly, Sid, who gives a shit?

1122
01:13:00,873 --> 01:13:02,610
You said it yourself,
he's gonna go after her.

1123
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:04,080
I put a tracker on her car.

1124
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:05,170
You did what?

1125
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,460
It seemed like something
Gale Weathers would do.

1126
01:13:08,271 --> 01:13:09,900
Take that as a compliment.

1127
01:13:11,909 --> 01:13:14,330
I left a message for Mom.
I told her where we're going.

1128
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:17,060
You good back there?

1129
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:19,604
Fuck, where is it?

1130
01:13:19,738 --> 01:13:20,760
Where's what?

1131
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:23,231
My inhaler.
I usually keep an extra one.

1132
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,460
Should we go back?

1133
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:26,540
Whoa. Okay.

1134
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:29,110
I vote for not going back
to the murder hospital.

1135
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:31,890
- You want to stop at a pharmacy?
- I'd need a prescription.

1136
01:13:32,046 --> 01:13:34,472
But I left an extra one at Amber's.
Her house is on the way.

1137
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,760
No... no, no, no.

1138
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,110
I'd be in and out.

1139
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:39,730
Could you hold out till Modesto?

1140
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,160
- I don't think so.
- Okay, what's the address?

1141
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:43,860
123 No Fucking Way Lane.

1142
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:45,901
Richie, she needs it.

1143
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,159
And I need to keep all the blood
inside my body. So do you.

1144
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,240
Richie, please.

1145
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,460
It's okay.

1146
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,170
Okay, yeah. Fuck.
What's the goddamn address?

1147
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:04,660
Hey, thanks for coming.

1148
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:18,490
Keep pouring, Wheeler.

1149
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:19,654
Thank you.

1150
01:14:20,214 --> 01:14:21,210
Hey.

1151
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,564
To Wes!

1152
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,350
To Wes!

1153
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:25,825
Beautiful son of a bitch.

1154
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,060
We love you, buddy!

1155
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,825
Shots, really?
This is supposed to be a memorial.

1156
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,740
Well, this is how I mourn

1157
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:35,574
and distract myself from
the looming specter of Death.

1158
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,100
Hey, we're low on beer.

1159
01:14:37,769 --> 01:14:39,900
There's more in the basement
I'll go get some.

1160
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,600
What the fuck, Mindy?
Jesus!

1161
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,830
That was a test.
And you failed.

1162
01:15:25,029 --> 01:15:27,200
Never go off on your own
with a masked killer around.

1163
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,269
You're the one that said
we needed more beer.

1164
01:15:29,354 --> 01:15:31,330
And you should have asked me
to come with you.

1165
01:15:33,536 --> 01:15:34,982
You know what else
you shouldn't do

1166
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:36,684
when there's
a masked killer around?

1167
01:15:36,794 --> 01:15:37,795
What?

1168
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:42,830
Follow someone into a dark,
creepy basement alone.

1169
01:15:44,503 --> 01:15:45,530
I mean...

1170
01:15:47,528 --> 01:15:48,973
how do you know
I'm not the killer?

1171
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:53,860
Because I am.

1172
01:15:58,023 --> 01:15:59,150
I'm not, actually.

1173
01:15:59,246 --> 01:16:00,940
But let that be a lesson.

1174
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,300
Don't trust anyone.

1175
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:07,392
Then how can I trust you when
you say you're not the killer?

1176
01:16:07,562 --> 01:16:08,562
Exactly.

1177
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:10,730
You're learning.

1178
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,730
Now let's go back upstairs.

1179
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:21,300
You first.

1180
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:23,842
Very good.

1181
01:16:36,454 --> 01:16:38,160
I think... I'm ready.

1182
01:16:39,448 --> 01:16:41,030
I mean,
I think we should.

1183
01:16:41,412 --> 01:16:44,060
Like now.
You want to go upstairs?

1184
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,364
Like... Like upstairs?

1185
01:16:46,465 --> 01:16:47,900
Uh-huh. Right now.

1186
01:16:49,623 --> 01:16:50,920
Um...

1187
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:54,569
Don't take this the wrong way,

1188
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:57,660
but I think I have
to pass on that.

1189
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,265
What?

1190
01:17:01,564 --> 01:17:02,774
Why?

1191
01:17:04,248 --> 01:17:10,100
You know, I'm not like entirely
sure that you're not the...

1192
01:17:11,232 --> 01:17:12,580
killer.

1193
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,538
"Don't take this
the wrong way"?

1194
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:19,397
No, no, look. I'm almost 100% certain
that you are not, but...

1195
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:22,670
the safest option
is to be down here

1196
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,968
with all the people...

1197
01:17:24,084 --> 01:17:25,080
Fuck you.

1198
01:17:25,178 --> 01:17:26,880
...and the potential witnesses.

1199
01:17:26,971 --> 01:17:29,460
That is a completely valid
emotional response to have.

1200
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,054
- That too.
- Fucking asshole.

1201
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:34,930
Good job.

1202
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:37,882
Fuck you, Mindy.

1203
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:41,469
If I hadn't have written that book
about your mother,

1204
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,149
- none of this would've happened.
- Gale.

1205
01:17:44,222 --> 01:17:46,960
- I started all of this.
- No, you didn't.

1206
01:17:47,517 --> 01:17:50,260
Billy Loomis started this,
and we're gonna end it.

1207
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:52,390
After tonight, no more books,

1208
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,980
no more movies,
no more fucking Ghostface.

1209
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,600
<i>Don't you know the rules?</i>

1210
01:17:57,690 --> 01:17:58,800
<i>What rules?</i>

1211
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:04,570
<i>There are specific rules</i>

1212
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:08,680
<i>that one must abide by to
successfully survive a horror movie.</i>

1213
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:10,084
- <i>For instance...</i>
- Okay.

1214
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,425
<i>Number one:</i>

1215
01:18:11,538 --> 01:18:14,040
- <i>You can never have sex.</i>
- Don't do it. Don't go outside after her.

1216
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:15,355
She's not texting me back.

1217
01:18:15,453 --> 01:18:16,660
Because she's probably dead.

1218
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,103
Jesus, Mindy.

1219
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:19,667
That's my girlfriend,
and I love her.

1220
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,200
Was your girlfriend.

1221
01:18:21,292 --> 01:18:23,580
You're just gonna sit and watch a movie
about our uncle getting stabbed?

1222
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:25,149
It calms me down, okay?

1223
01:18:25,249 --> 01:18:26,629
I'm also gonna
smoke some weed

1224
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:28,900
and possibly hook up
with Frances.

1225
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:31,646
Have fun.

1226
01:18:31,787 --> 01:18:34,260
Oh, my God, at least
take some sort of weapon.

1227
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,040
Here you go.

1228
01:18:50,042 --> 01:18:51,130
All right.

1229
01:18:56,957 --> 01:18:57,940
What?

1230
01:19:20,458 --> 01:19:21,830
Liv?

1231
01:19:27,197 --> 01:19:28,430
Liv?

1232
01:19:52,275 --> 01:19:54,660
All right.
Okay, yeah, no.

1233
01:19:56,577 --> 01:19:57,578
Shit!

1234
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:09,745
Fuck!

1235
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:34,860
Please, please, please.

1236
01:21:08,659 --> 01:21:10,342
Whoa! Stop! Wait!

1237
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:26,164
Oh, perfect.
She's having a party.

1238
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:28,690
Who has a party in
the middle of a killing spree?

1239
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,465
- Look, I'm aborting the plan.
- No, we're already here.

1240
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:33,924
I'll go in quickly and get it.
I'll be back in five.

1241
01:21:34,018 --> 01:21:35,019
I'm coming too.

1242
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:37,620
If you think I'm waiting out here
just to get murdered,

1243
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:39,017
you're out of your mind.

1244
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:50,760
Tara!

1245
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:54,010
What are you doing
out of the hospital?

1246
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,722
Should you even be up
and around?

1247
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:56,919
I need my spare inhaler.

1248
01:21:57,008 --> 01:21:58,330
Why? Where are you going?

1249
01:22:01,805 --> 01:22:04,560
It's fine. Don't tell me.
I get it. Just be safe, okay?

1250
01:22:06,347 --> 01:22:07,660
I think it's in my room.

1251
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:10,500
All right, everyone!

1252
01:22:10,633 --> 01:22:13,380
Thanks for coming,
but the party's over!

1253
01:22:13,551 --> 01:22:14,330
Why?

1254
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:15,860
- Time to go!
- Why?

1255
01:22:15,959 --> 01:22:17,390
But it's so early!

1256
01:22:18,065 --> 01:22:19,060
Let's go.

1257
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:22,890
Hey, hey, hey! Hello!

1258
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:24,652
Can we cut the music, please?

1259
01:22:26,237 --> 01:22:29,700
Uh, hi... Gen Z.
How are you? Um...

1260
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:33,670
Both Sam and Tara here
have been attacked by the killer twice.

1261
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:37,410
And now they're here, which makes
this place a huge murder target, so...

1262
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:39,505
if I were you,
I would probably leave.

1263
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:42,586
Okay, I tried to be nice.
Get the fuck out!

1264
01:22:42,778 --> 01:22:44,410
Please get the fuck out.

1265
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,660
- Sincerely, get the fuck out.
- Buzzkill!

1266
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,530
Thank you. Thank you all.

1267
01:22:48,667 --> 01:22:51,425
I'm saving your life.
I promise.

1268
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,303
Thanks, teens.

1269
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:56,941
Thank you so much.

1270
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:59,530
Great. Thank you
for leaving the cup.

1271
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:00,750
Thank you.

1272
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:02,400
Saving your life.

1273
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:04,630
I'm saving your life.

1274
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:07,660
Saving your life, thank you.

1275
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,700
<i>And number three:</i>

1276
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,140
<i>Never, ever, ever,
under any circumstances,</i>

1277
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:15,160
<i>say, "I'll be right back."</i>

1278
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,587
<i>'Cause you won't be back.</i>

1279
01:23:17,078 --> 01:23:19,859
Hey, somebody's goofy-ass dad's
kicking us out.

1280
01:23:19,959 --> 01:23:21,530
Goddamn it.

1281
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:22,730
Thank you.

1282
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:24,317
Thanks, guys,
have a good night.

1283
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:25,550
- You have my number.
- Bye.

1284
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,640
Bye.

1285
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:40,444
Hi. Uh...

1286
01:23:40,572 --> 01:23:42,850
Is there any beer left?
There's none in the kitchen.

1287
01:23:42,957 --> 01:23:45,530
Yes, Richie.
There's beer in the basement.

1288
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,330
Right behind you.
Basement.

1289
01:23:48,853 --> 01:23:49,850
Yeah.

1290
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:52,160
Do you want
to come with me?

1291
01:23:52,869 --> 01:23:53,810
No.

1292
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,159
But you were right to ask.

1293
01:23:55,326 --> 01:23:56,870
Yeah. Um...

1294
01:23:58,850 --> 01:23:59,974
Okay, I'll be right back.

1295
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:04,802
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

1296
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,040
Well, he's dead.

1297
01:24:08,602 --> 01:24:10,730
The goddamn fucking Uber
canceled on me!

1298
01:24:10,976 --> 01:24:11,976
Great.

1299
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:13,437
Now I can't have sex,

1300
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:15,322
and I can't get a ride home.

1301
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,182
Could this night
get any shittier?

1302
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:19,550
Liv, where's my brother?

1303
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:21,928
What? I don't know, Mindy.

1304
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,288
Probably off accusing everyone
of being the killer!

1305
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,292
He actually went looking
for you.

1306
01:24:28,911 --> 01:24:30,900
I didn't see him.
Okay?

1307
01:24:32,296 --> 01:24:33,864
Why are you looking at me
like that?

1308
01:24:35,014 --> 01:24:37,410
Just revising my suspect list.

1309
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,630
Fuck this!

1310
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:50,630
Are you afraid of me, Mindy?

1311
01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:56,160
You think I did something
to your brother? Huh?

1312
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,600
You think I'm gonna...
cut you up?

1313
01:25:00,652 --> 01:25:02,630
A little bit now... yeah.

1314
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:07,060
I thought you said I was
too boring to be the killer.

1315
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:10,031
Maybe that's the twist.

1316
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,768
What do you think, huh?

1317
01:25:13,917 --> 01:25:15,172
You're the expert.

1318
01:25:16,675 --> 01:25:20,760
You know what eventually happens
to the expert?

1319
01:25:21,795 --> 01:25:22,800
What?

1320
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,830
Enjoy your stupid movie.

1321
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:36,430
Fucking psycho.

1322
01:25:36,743 --> 01:25:37,960
They stopped.

1323
01:25:38,111 --> 01:25:40,160
- Gas station?
- No. I...

1324
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,260
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1325
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:47,482
Oh, shit.
How far are we?

1326
01:25:47,589 --> 01:25:48,760
Too far.

1327
01:25:49,406 --> 01:25:50,713
Damn it.

1328
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:52,800
Tara, we're leaving!

1329
01:25:59,037 --> 01:25:59,680
Hello.

1330
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,660
You need to get out
of that house right now.

1331
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:02,887
How do you know where I am?

1332
01:26:02,976 --> 01:26:04,540
You're in Stu Macher's house,

1333
01:26:04,622 --> 01:26:06,060
<i>where your dad and Stu
killed everyone.</i>

1334
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:07,381
<i>Someone planned to get you there.</i>

1335
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:09,311
<i>You need to get
the fuck out, Sam!</i>

1336
01:26:17,349 --> 01:26:19,560
<i>No, Jamie. Watch out.</i>

1337
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:21,660
<i>Watch out, Jamie.</i>

1338
01:26:22,317 --> 01:26:23,635
<i>You know he's around.</i>

1339
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,084
- What?
- <i>There he is.</i>

1340
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:30,541
Come on, man, turn around!
Turn around! Dude!

1341
01:26:30,762 --> 01:26:31,906
<i>I told you.</i>

1342
01:26:32,039 --> 01:26:34,629
<i>I told you, he's around the corner.
Jamie.</i>

1343
01:26:34,831 --> 01:26:37,900
- <i>Look behind you.</i>
- No, Randy, look behind you.

1344
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:40,250
- Come on, man, turn around!
- <i>Behind you.</i>

1345
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,970
- Dude, what are you doing?
- <i>Turn around!</i>

1346
01:26:42,065 --> 01:26:43,260
- You can do it!
- <i>Behind you.</i>

1347
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:45,830
These are your rules!
Own that shit.

1348
01:26:46,489 --> 01:26:48,229
<i>Behind you! Turn around.</i>

1349
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:50,508
Look behind...

1350
01:26:52,545 --> 01:26:53,700
Oh, shit!

1351
01:27:12,146 --> 01:27:14,681
- Mindy.
- That's a lot of blood, Sam.

1352
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:17,029
No, Mindy, stay with me.

1353
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:20,497
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.

1354
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:22,060
No, I didn't do anything.

1355
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:24,260
- The killer, he...
- Is she okay?

1356
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:25,829
What the fuck?

1357
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:27,326
Richie, where the fuck were you?

1358
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,884
I went into the basement
to get beer.

1359
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,202
You went to the basement alone?

1360
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:32,355
I asked her to come with me!
She said no!

1361
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:33,630
Fuck!

1362
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:35,012
Stay the fuck back.

1363
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:36,252
Jesus Christ!

1364
01:27:36,347 --> 01:27:38,886
I was with Tara, but the rest of you
were wandering around.

1365
01:27:38,976 --> 01:27:40,840
One of you is the fucking killer!

1366
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:43,300
Fuck you, Amber.
Fuck you!

1367
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:44,880
Why is there blood on your hands?

1368
01:27:45,006 --> 01:27:46,020
What?

1369
01:27:48,065 --> 01:27:49,380
I found Chad.

1370
01:27:49,513 --> 01:27:51,400
- I found Chad and he's...
- Chad?

1371
01:27:51,791 --> 01:27:53,860
- You're fucking lying.
- No.

1372
01:27:54,008 --> 01:27:55,780
- You're the killer.
- No, I'm not.

1373
01:27:55,879 --> 01:27:57,130
Liv, stop.

1374
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:59,170
- Fuck you!
- Liv, just stop!

1375
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:03,040
Fuck you, Amber.
I'm not the fucking killer!

1376
01:28:03,174 --> 01:28:04,174
I know.

1377
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:08,810
Welcome to act three.

1378
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:10,040
Run!

1379
01:28:12,446 --> 01:28:13,440
Holy shit!

1380
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,957
- Sam, come on!
- No...

1381
01:28:15,079 --> 01:28:17,630
Run! Go, go, go! Go!

1382
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:20,769
Oh, my God.
Holy shit!

1383
01:28:21,287 --> 01:28:23,029
- Oh, my God... Tara!
- Wait, no, Sam.

1384
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,142
- She has a gun.
- Richie.

1385
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:26,362
There are always two killers.

1386
01:28:35,261 --> 01:28:36,630
Sam, please put the knife down.

1387
01:28:39,277 --> 01:28:40,460
Look, I think...

1388
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,380
- I think the other killer might be Tara.
- What?

1389
01:28:43,470 --> 01:28:44,800
She's the one that brought us here

1390
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,835
and you two have been
estranged for years.

1391
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:49,600
I mean...

1392
01:28:50,686 --> 01:28:52,222
how well do you
really know her?

1393
01:28:52,755 --> 01:28:54,200
Better than I know you.

1394
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,900
Sam, wait, whoa. Sam!

1395
01:29:15,753 --> 01:29:16,883
Sounds about right.

1396
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:18,810
You ready?

1397
01:29:18,915 --> 01:29:20,680
For this? Never.

1398
01:29:21,639 --> 01:29:22,710
Here we go.

1399
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:32,486
Help me, help me!
He stabbed me!

1400
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:34,538
- What do you think?
- Trap.

1401
01:29:35,113 --> 01:29:36,116
Fuck it.

1402
01:29:36,416 --> 01:29:37,301
Ow!

1403
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:41,456
Gale! Gale!

1404
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,280
Wait. Let me see.
Let me see.

1405
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,980
You got to go to the hospital.

1406
01:29:45,334 --> 01:29:46,374
No.

1407
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:48,282
You said we were
gonna finish this.

1408
01:29:48,423 --> 01:29:49,480
Go finish it, Sidney.

1409
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,350
Gale.

1410
01:29:52,119 --> 01:29:53,113
For Dewey.

1411
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:35,551
Anyone hiding, killer or not.

1412
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:38,060
You have five seconds
to show yourself!

1413
01:31:11,869 --> 01:31:12,980
Oh, Tara.

1414
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:14,260
Oh, my God.

1415
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:24,069
Sam.

1416
01:31:24,911 --> 01:31:26,200
Sam, please.

1417
01:31:35,677 --> 01:31:38,153
<i>Hello, Sidney!</i>

1418
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:41,018
Hello there.
Where'd you go?

1419
01:31:41,028 --> 01:31:44,160
<i>Oh, this isn't Amber.
I'm the other one.</i>

1420
01:31:45,133 --> 01:31:47,980
Oh. There's two of you.
Again.

1421
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,330
I've seen this movie before.

1422
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:52,330
<i>Not this movie, Sidney.</i>

1423
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:54,256
You really need
some new material.

1424
01:31:55,616 --> 01:31:57,372
<i>I got you here, didn't I?</i>

1425
01:31:58,393 --> 01:32:00,600
You might actually be
the most derivative one of all.

1426
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:02,330
I mean, Christ,
the same house?

1427
01:32:02,454 --> 01:32:03,450
<i>Maybe so.</i>

1428
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:06,656
<i>But you forgot the first rule
of surviving a Stab movie.</i>

1429
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:08,252
- <i>Never answer the...</i>
- I'm bored.

1430
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:09,345
<i>Wait!</i>

1431
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:15,433
Put your hands up!
Show me your hands!

1432
01:32:15,526 --> 01:32:16,620
What are you doing in there?

1433
01:32:16,712 --> 01:32:18,450
Hiding from murderers.

1434
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:19,555
I told you to come out!

1435
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:21,437
I'm not gonna come out!
You're shooting everything!

1436
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:25,130
Holy shit,
it's Ghostface!

1437
01:32:40,802 --> 01:32:43,022
Richie! Gun. Get the gun.

1438
01:32:43,142 --> 01:32:45,620
Yeah, kind of hard
since you shot me in the leg.

1439
01:32:45,869 --> 01:32:47,369
Fuck. Fuck.

1440
01:32:56,164 --> 01:32:58,060
- Yes! Yes!
- Shoot him!

1441
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,172
Thank God you're okay.

1442
01:33:06,209 --> 01:33:07,418
'Cause I really...

1443
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,980
really wanted to be
the one to kill you.

1444
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,486
Sit the fuck down, Prescott!

1445
01:33:38,781 --> 01:33:40,260
I can't believe this worked.

1446
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:48,080
I know.
It's a bummer it's me.

1447
01:33:52,465 --> 01:33:54,580
But it really was
the best choice for the movie.

1448
01:33:57,406 --> 01:33:59,460
This isn't a fucking movie!

1449
01:34:00,503 --> 01:34:02,430
No. But it will be.

1450
01:34:03,950 --> 01:34:05,311
That's the point, right, Amber?

1451
01:34:05,402 --> 01:34:06,700
Right, hon!

1452
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,660
Third Act bloodbath, check.

1453
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:10,439
Killers revealed, check!

1454
01:34:10,530 --> 01:34:12,330
Time for the big finale!

1455
01:34:15,212 --> 01:34:17,340
- Richie...
- Shh, shh...

1456
01:34:18,930 --> 01:34:21,130
Okay. Okay.

1457
01:34:21,326 --> 01:34:22,907
Let's get 'em
into the kitchen.

1458
01:34:24,111 --> 01:34:25,277
Let's go, bitch!

1459
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,824
Someone has to save
the franchise.

1460
01:34:27,950 --> 01:34:28,950
You see,

1461
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:32,440
no one has made a great
<i>Stab</i> movie since the first one.

1462
01:34:33,019 --> 01:34:34,149
Not really.

1463
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:37,680
Hey, baby, you want to go get
the very ex-Mrs. Riley?

1464
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:38,830
Yeah, I do.

1465
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:41,060
Hey, hey!

1466
01:34:41,171 --> 01:34:43,630
Whoa... whoa.

1467
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,160
Sidney Prescott.

1468
01:34:46,461 --> 01:34:47,700
You know...

1469
01:34:49,129 --> 01:34:50,490
I'm a really big fan.

1470
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:51,682
Go fuck yourself.

1471
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:53,617
You see the last <i>Stab</i> movie?

1472
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:55,452
Not really a fan
of scary movies.

1473
01:34:55,578 --> 01:34:57,798
That checks out.
Anyway, it sucked balls.

1474
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,100
Because nobody takes
the true fans seriously.

1475
01:35:00,190 --> 01:35:01,360
Not really.

1476
01:35:02,282 --> 01:35:04,330
They just laugh at us, and why?

1477
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:06,500
Because we love something?

1478
01:35:07,088 --> 01:35:08,740
We're just a fucking joke to them?

1479
01:35:09,821 --> 01:35:13,500
How can fandom be toxic?

1480
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:15,232
It's about love!

1481
01:35:15,338 --> 01:35:17,450
They don't fucking understand
that these movies

1482
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:19,042
are important to people.

1483
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:20,711
- Richie...
- We're gonna help them!

1484
01:35:21,486 --> 01:35:24,140
Hollywood's totally
fucking out of ideas,

1485
01:35:24,259 --> 01:35:27,471
so we decided we'd give them some
new source material to follow.

1486
01:35:27,608 --> 01:35:29,398
You know,
bring it back to basics.

1487
01:35:29,530 --> 01:35:31,621
Because that's how you make
a great <i>Stab</i> movie, Sam.

1488
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:34,270
"Based on actual events."

1489
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,413
- Gale.
- Sit the fuck down!

1490
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:39,858
Back up.

1491
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:40,864
Back up.

1492
01:35:46,065 --> 01:35:48,863
You did all this
just to make me the hero

1493
01:35:48,973 --> 01:35:50,367
of your fucked-up movie?

1494
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:53,300
Sweetie, you're not the hero.

1495
01:35:55,450 --> 01:35:56,760
You're the villain.

1496
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:59,007
The daughter of Billy Loomis

1497
01:35:59,139 --> 01:36:01,480
who sees fucked-up visions
of her dead dad?

1498
01:36:01,639 --> 01:36:03,400
Sidney Prescott
killed your father.

1499
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:04,987
You...

1500
01:36:05,088 --> 01:36:08,600
did all this just to get her
back to Woodsboro.

1501
01:36:09,886 --> 01:36:11,680
You know what
the biggest problem

1502
01:36:11,782 --> 01:36:13,554
with the <i>Stab</i> movies is?

1503
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:16,820
There's no Michael Myers
or Jason Voorhees.

1504
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,419
No bad guy to keep coming back.

1505
01:36:19,955 --> 01:36:22,600
But the illegitimate daughter
of the original mastermind?

1506
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:25,757
Now that's a fucking villain.

1507
01:36:25,876 --> 01:36:28,600
- How did you know?
- About your father?

1508
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:33,160
It's a small town,
and your mom's a drunk!

1509
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,830
I met Richie on the <i>Stab</i> subreddit.

1510
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:40,100
I've been obsessed ever since
my parents bought this house.

1511
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,527
We realized pretty quickly
we had similar ideas.

1512
01:36:43,623 --> 01:36:45,951
Wasn't that hard for me
to find you in Modesto.

1513
01:36:46,830 --> 01:36:49,130
It wasn't that hard for me
to fuck you, either.

1514
01:36:49,232 --> 01:36:50,830
But I guess being a sexually
available woman

1515
01:36:50,915 --> 01:36:52,460
is supposed to be
empowering these days.

1516
01:36:52,562 --> 01:36:53,970
Fuck you!

1517
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:56,560
Well, now you're just
quoting the original.

1518
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:59,155
But it wouldn't work
with just you, Sam.

1519
01:36:59,791 --> 01:37:03,230
See, we had to bring the legacy
characters back to make it matter.

1520
01:37:04,210 --> 01:37:07,030
Can't have a bona fide Halloween
without Jamie Lee!

1521
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:08,110
Nope!

1522
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:09,800
Dewey had to die to make it real.

1523
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:12,428
To show that this wasn't
just some bullshit,

1524
01:37:12,599 --> 01:37:15,390
cash-in,
run-of-the-mill sequel.

1525
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:19,231
Because our movie
has fucking stakes!

1526
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:22,800
'Cause anyone can die
in a requel.

1527
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:25,710
- No!
- Whoa, whoa!

1528
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:29,364
Goddamn it. Whoa, whoa!

1529
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:31,543
No, hey!
Sit the fuck down.

1530
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:37,360
I'm so sorry, Sid.

1531
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:39,206
We can't let you live either.

1532
01:37:39,339 --> 01:37:41,308
I mean,
surviving this many times...

1533
01:37:41,789 --> 01:37:43,380
that would just be ridiculous.

1534
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:47,000
This time the fans
are gonna be the ones who win.

1535
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:50,700
That about cover it?

1536
01:37:50,816 --> 01:37:52,360
Nailed it, baby.

1537
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:54,890
Get Tara out of the closet.

1538
01:37:55,010 --> 01:37:56,766
We got to start staging
the bodies!

1539
01:37:57,935 --> 01:37:59,305
Stay with me, Sid.

1540
01:38:00,441 --> 01:38:01,441
Stay with me.

1541
01:38:01,570 --> 01:38:03,760
You really should've listened
to Dewey.

1542
01:38:04,157 --> 01:38:05,520
He nailed it in one!

1543
01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:07,529
Dude, look at the love interest!

1544
01:38:07,659 --> 01:38:09,010
Are you fucking stupid?

1545
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:11,281
I even had you convinced
it could be your sister.

1546
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:15,240
Um, she's not here.

1547
01:38:18,701 --> 01:38:20,621
What the fuck do you mean,
"She's not here"?

1548
01:38:20,771 --> 01:38:22,101
She's not here!

1549
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:23,500
I untied her.

1550
01:38:25,663 --> 01:38:27,797
Guess you're not as persuasive
as you thought.

1551
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:34,871
That's for you.

1552
01:38:35,871 --> 01:38:36,951
Yeah.

1553
01:38:37,394 --> 01:38:39,191
Like your gimpy little sister's
gonna make a difference.

1554
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:41,485
She's our fucking pincushion
at this point.

1555
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:44,461
Amber! Fan out.
She couldn't have gotten far.

1556
01:38:44,671 --> 01:38:45,815
I can't find her!

1557
01:38:53,261 --> 01:38:54,261
Amber?

1558
01:39:16,492 --> 01:39:18,741
Sam! Where you going?

1559
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,183
Your big scene's coming up!

1560
01:39:28,671 --> 01:39:30,059
Fucking kill you!

1561
01:39:33,252 --> 01:39:34,912
The fucking hand sanitizer?

1562
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:43,800
No, no, no, it's not my fault!
It's not my fault!

1563
01:39:44,012 --> 01:39:45,700
Let me guess,
the movies made you do it?

1564
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:48,300
No, it was the message boards!
I was radicalized.

1565
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:49,450
By movie fans?

1566
01:39:49,555 --> 01:39:50,565
Yes, they're so mad!

1567
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:52,255
Please, it's not my fault
I'm just a dumb kid.

1568
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:53,820
I wanted to be a part of something.

1569
01:39:53,917 --> 01:39:57,150
"A part of something"?
You killed my best friend!

1570
01:39:57,524 --> 01:39:59,274
Yeah, and he died like a pussy.

1571
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:14,600
That's the thing
about slashers, Sam.

1572
01:40:16,896 --> 01:40:18,450
So many blood trails.

1573
01:40:19,067 --> 01:40:20,230
This one yours?

1574
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:23,000
Only one way to find out!

1575
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:32,470
I was the last thing Dewey saw
before he died too.

1576
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,660
I can't believe
I get to do you both.

1577
01:40:36,259 --> 01:40:37,951
No last-minute saves this time.

1578
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:39,400
Your story's over!

1579
01:40:45,035 --> 01:40:46,830
Time to pass the torch.

1580
01:40:47,543 --> 01:40:49,083
It's all yours, bitch!

1581
01:40:53,370 --> 01:40:55,600
- You want to do the honors?
- This one's yours.

1582
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:03,350
No, stop, stop, stop!
I'm sorry about Dewey.

1583
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:04,465
Fuck you.

1584
01:41:18,827 --> 01:41:20,360
Enjoy that torch.

1585
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,060
Stop...

1586
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:40,330
fucking up...

1587
01:41:40,430 --> 01:41:41,959
my ending!

1588
01:41:48,553 --> 01:41:49,550
Sam?

1589
01:41:51,494 --> 01:41:52,600
Sam!

1590
01:42:01,678 --> 01:42:02,930
Okay.

1591
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:11,420
What are you gonna do now, huh?

1592
01:42:11,783 --> 01:42:13,630
Make a scary phone call to me?

1593
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:17,307
Pop out of that closet
in a Ghostface mask?

1594
01:42:18,294 --> 01:42:19,295
No.

1595
01:42:20,435 --> 01:42:21,865
Because you're the villain!

1596
01:42:23,466 --> 01:42:25,802
And the villain dies at the end.

1597
01:42:26,035 --> 01:42:27,460
Those are the rules.

1598
01:42:28,812 --> 01:42:30,300
I'm introducing a new rule.

1599
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:33,660
And what would that be? Huh?

1600
01:42:35,079 --> 01:42:36,079
Well?

1601
01:42:38,882 --> 01:42:41,162
Never fuck with
the daughter of a serial killer.

1602
01:43:04,661 --> 01:43:06,499
Wait!

1603
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:12,230
What about... my ending?

1604
01:43:17,627 --> 01:43:19,000
Here it comes.

1605
01:43:19,126 --> 01:43:20,694
No!

1606
01:43:56,328 --> 01:43:57,886
Careful,
they always come back.

1607
01:44:09,273 --> 01:44:10,620
Okay, then.

1608
01:44:19,414 --> 01:44:21,067
I still prefer <i>The Babadook.</i>

1609
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:36,220
Are you okay?

1610
01:44:36,362 --> 01:44:37,882
- Are you good?
- Mm-hmm.

1611
01:44:48,275 --> 01:44:49,277
I'm so sorry.

1612
01:44:49,418 --> 01:44:50,518
Excuse me.

1613
01:44:51,891 --> 01:44:53,041
Excuse me, sir.

1614
01:44:55,529 --> 01:44:56,559
Hey.

1615
01:44:57,220 --> 01:44:57,923
Hey.

1616
01:44:58,013 --> 01:44:59,213
She's gonna be okay.

1617
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,020
Can you take us to a different
hospital this time?

1618
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:15,213
Of course.

1619
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:19,450
You ready to go?

1620
01:45:24,762 --> 01:45:26,350
I'll be right back, yeah?

1621
01:45:33,030 --> 01:45:34,310
Your vitals look good.

1622
01:45:35,349 --> 01:45:36,877
You sit tight for a draft, okay?

1623
01:45:37,508 --> 01:45:39,478
Sidney. Gale.

1624
01:45:42,583 --> 01:45:43,730
Thank you both.

1625
01:45:44,808 --> 01:45:45,808
For everything.

1626
01:45:47,768 --> 01:45:49,105
Are you gonna be all right?

1627
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:52,650
I'll survive.
I always do.

1628
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:54,644
You were right...

1629
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:56,670
about not running.

1630
01:45:57,574 --> 01:45:58,810
Sorry about that.

1631
01:46:01,056 --> 01:46:02,056
How are you doing?

1632
01:46:03,910 --> 01:46:05,310
Ask me in a few days.

1633
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:09,442
But at least I know
what I'm gonna write about.

1634
01:46:09,974 --> 01:46:10,976
What's that?

1635
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:12,980
Not this.

1636
01:46:13,707 --> 01:46:15,498
Those fuckers can die
in anonymity.

1637
01:46:16,656 --> 01:46:17,770
But maybe something about

1638
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:20,381
a good man who used to be
the sheriff here once.

1639
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:23,310
I'd like to read that story.

1640
01:46:25,330 --> 01:46:26,776
Can I ask you a weird question?

1641
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:28,750
Yeah.

1642
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:31,650
Am I gonna be okay?

1643
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:35,520
Eventually.

1644
01:47:00,249 --> 01:47:02,310
- Hey.
- Wait. Sam, Sam!

1645
01:47:03,189 --> 01:47:04,189
Thank you.

1646
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:09,181
Well, you're not going
anywhere without me.

1647
01:47:10,728 --> 01:47:11,871
Don't worry.

1648
01:47:12,330 --> 01:47:14,378
I'm gonna hold your hand
all the way there.

1649
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:20,273
I can take care of her
and her sister.

1650
01:47:20,410 --> 01:47:22,010
She's all ready
for transportation.

1651
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:34,670
25 years ago,
almost to the day,

1652
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,974
in this very house
a tragic story ended.

1653
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:41,219
Tonight, a new chapter
came to a close.

1654
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:43,674
Police do not have
a lot of information right now,

1655
01:47:43,780 --> 01:47:45,510
as they are still collecting evidence.

1656
01:47:45,618 --> 01:47:48,652
As you can see, this is
a very active crime scene.

1657
01:47:48,812 --> 01:47:51,288
An unknown number of fatalities,
several injuries,

1658
01:47:51,406 --> 01:47:54,806
some people being taken off by
ambulance right now as we speak.

1659
01:47:54,930 --> 01:47:56,506
This is a developing story...

1660
01:47:56,680 --> 01:48:03,080
