1
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:57,332
(This film takes place in the 1980s.)

2
00:00:57,332 --> 00:00:58,498
(Nonetheless this is a work of fiction,

3
00:00:58,499 --> 00:00:59,790
and any similarity to persons living or dead,
agencies and institutions,)

4
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,582
(or actual events and cases mentioned
in the film is purely coincidental.)

5
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,916
1983, Washington

6
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,374
Protests already in Los Angeles
and New York City.

7
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:14,165
- (Summit Turns Its Back on Trampled Democracy)
- Now another in Washington,

8
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:18,374
his one by local Korean-Americans following the
summit between the President of the United States

9
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:20,915
- Down with the dictator!
- and the President of South Korea.

10
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:23,832
The protesters are outraged
by their president's use of

11
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:26,915
- No More dictatorship!
- a military insurrection to expand his authority,

12
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,999
- Down with the dictator!
- and undermine liberal democracy

13
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,249
in their home country,

14
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:33,416
- Drive him out!
- resulting in the deaths of South Korean civilians.

15
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:38,291
One sign seen in the protests said,

16
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:42,748
"Revolution Without Democracy is Violence".

17
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:01,832
Got it, report in as soon as he
leaves the White House!

18
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,207
When is the protest being broken up?!

19
00:02:06,332 --> 00:02:10,665
They have an official permit.
We can't break it up.

20
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,624
Stop the massacres!

21
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:15,373
Stop them! Stop them!

22
00:02:16,582 --> 00:02:19,915
Look at those effigies of the president!

23
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:24,832
Call me when the president passes Georgia Avenue.

24
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,124
(Murderer)

25
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:43,707
Chief Park!

26
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:45,874
Why don't you do something?

27
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,290
Get your Foreign Unit to break up the crowd!

28
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:50,624
Want the president to use the back door?

29
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:58,748
Why's the Domestic Unit here
breathing up our asses?

30
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,249
Chief Park.

31
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:11,790
Can you feel the passion
for our president out there?

32
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,249
What should the tone of my article be?

33
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:18,540
Mr. Kang, a reporter needn't worry about tone.

34
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:20,707
Come with me, I'll educate you.

35
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:27,665
They sure are opinionated

36
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,541
- (Chief of East Asia, CIA) (Director of KCIA)
- after abandoning their country.

37
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:35,457
I hear Korean students keep
demanding the withdrawal of US troops.

38
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:42,666
It's all because the president
suppressed citizens by force.

39
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:49,582
Come on, Director, that's all in the past.

40
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,207
It was a just suppression.

41
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:57,957
You know why it's so important
he holds onto power?

42
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:01,874
If Korea falls, Okinawa will too,

43
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:06,332
and our entire military presence
in the Asia-Pacific.

44
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,166
The existing order will collapse.

45
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,415
Don't you worry.

46
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:15,957
He's amending the constitution
and the election process to retain power.

47
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:22,249
Hey, listen to channel 4.

48
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:27,457
Channel 4, 5 o'clock. Rooftop!

49
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:31,582
Respond, Channel 4,
5 o'clock. Rooftop!

50
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:35,499
Come in.

51
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,416
Sir, we just intercepted this.

52
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:48,082
Sir!

53
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:51,332
The CIA detected a plot to
assassinate the president!

54
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,541
What?

55
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,957
Stop the car! Now!

56
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,165
I think we've been spotted,
what should we do?

57
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:02,582
Can you take him out from here?

58
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,999
No, it's too far.

59
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:06,707
Dammit, pull out!

60
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:20,873
What's his location?

61
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:23,540
He's passing the dressing room!

62
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:04,790
Ju-kyung!

63
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,082
Ju-kyung!

64
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,832
I'm okay!

65
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:21,832
Sir!

66
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,999


67
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:27,957
Shut down the whole building!

68
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,832
Need to capture him alive!

69
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:34,582
You're done, give up!

70
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:36,040
Put the gun down!

71
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:37,165
Stay back.

72
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,124
Gun down!

73
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,582
I was just following orders!

74
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:41,873
Stay back!

75
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:42,998
Back off!

76
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,041
How could you Kill the suspect?

77
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:05,457
You shouldn't have been taken hostage!

78
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,166
Wipe off that blood.

79
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:22,624
"Hunt"

80
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,957
No more!

81
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:31,415
No more dictatorship!

82
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,749
Restore democracy!

83
00:08:40,374 --> 00:08:43,499
How could they send riot cops onto campus?

84
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:47,248
Everyone disperse!

85
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:53,249
Go home, and be careful.

86
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,624
Hey! Over here!

87
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:08,207
Open the gate!

88
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,040
Please open the gate!

89
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,499
The screwdriver! Pull it out!

90
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:17,415
Right there! Screwdriver!

91
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:57,040
Hello?

92
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,665
Yes, this is he.

93
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,416
My God, I didn't know, I am so sorry!

94
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:05,665
Motherfuckers!

95
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:08,165
You think your parents
paid tuition for you to do this?

96
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:09,665
You piece of shit!

97
00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:12,249
Stop hitting them!

98
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:14,665
Hey! That girl, there. Move, you idiot!

99
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:15,790
Hey, stop!

100
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:17,165
Are you out of your fucking mind, bitch?!

101
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:17,999
Det. Kim!

102
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,623
Yes, yes, of course, sir.

103
00:10:19,707 --> 00:10:21,165
Yes, I understand!

104
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:23,082
Everyone out!

105
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:49,040
Watch his head.

106
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:53,123
Thank you so much, sir

107
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:54,957
Go to my place.

108
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,290
I'm hungry, let's go.

109
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:16,749
So I'm your father?

110
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:18,373
I didn't say you were my father.

111
00:11:18,457 --> 00:11:21,373
Now you protest with them instead of studying?

112
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,957
I wasn't protesting.

113
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,582
Sir, don't misunderstand.

114
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,999
Your daughter wasn't protesting,
she just opened the gate for us.

115
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:34,999
That's the truth, I wasn't protesting at all.

116
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,999
Send them away,

117
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:42,290
and don't ever hang out with them.

118
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:45,374
Yes sir, we won't hang out with your daughter!

119
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:46,957
He's not my dad!

120
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:55,415
Tuition fee for this semester.

121
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:04,123
Stay for dinner!

122
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:10,373
Director Kang called the meeting.

123
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:12,832
It seems he got grilled by the president

124
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,207
for not finding who
planned the Washington incident.

125
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:19,666
Agents of Foreign Unit are
active in cities visited by the President,

126
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:24,207
and the Domestic Unit is questioning delegations,
to Washington especially.

127
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:30,623
Director is trying to pin this on Prof.
Shin Ki-cheol.

128
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,332
Why him?

129
00:12:32,624 --> 00:12:36,499
He was on the Washington delegation
on an economic mission.

130
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:41,124
Director Kang says he's 'Donglim',
the leader of an espionage cell.

131
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:43,332
Donglim?

132
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:48,915
First, name that professor as the spy Donglim,

133
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:52,832
Link him with the assassins and
prepare a report for the president.

134
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:56,374
But the US hasn't shared its intel with us yet,

135
00:12:56,457 --> 00:12:57,790
so proving a connection with North Korea...

136
00:12:57,874 --> 00:12:59,957
Look, Chief Kim!

137
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:03,415
They knew all the president's
movements in advance!

138
00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:06,457
Did you investigate the whole
delegation before the US trip?

139
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:08,790
But you call yourself the Chief
of the Domestic Unit?

140
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,874
This is why the President's Office
wants to disband the KCIA!

141
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,457
Get his confession now.

142
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,082
If you don't resolve the Washington incident,

143
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,582
you two are done.

144
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,041
Yes, sir.

145
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:23,582
One more thing...

146
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:26,082
What should we do about 417 Special Forces?

147
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:27,415
What about it?

148
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:30,082
The op begins at midnight in 2 days.

149
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:32,123
Then stick to schedule!

150
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,957
It's an op with very low chance of success, sir.

151
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,916
Why not use my Foreign agents to gather
intel on the nuclear threat?

152
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,999
You want me to scrap it now?

153
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,540
It's approved by the president!

154
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:45,123
Proceed!

155
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:51,665
This is the President's itinerary
for his Japan visit, sign off on it.

156
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,374
(Chief of Foreign Unit: Park Pyong-ho)

157
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:08,290
(Chief of Domestic Unit: Kim Jung-do)

158
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,998
He's a tough nut since he has the president's ear.

159
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:16,874
I'm still not used to this
since I spent my life in the army.

160
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:19,165
I'd appreciate your guidance.

161
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:21,540
Speaking of which.

162
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:24,790
My wife told me to invite my
colleagues for dinner,

163
00:14:24,874 --> 00:14:27,249
but my home is too tiny to invite them all.

164
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,499
Would you like to join us for dinner?

165
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:34,957
Certainly.

166
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,457
He's ripe for picking.

167
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,957
Let's wrap up the Donglim case.

168
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:48,165
Bring him to Room 2.

169
00:14:58,082 --> 00:14:59,790
Afternoon, sir.

170
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,916
You dislocated his shoulder again?

171
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:14,957
Why keep doing that?
Your job is to break his will.

172
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,623
Dress him and bring him to Room 2.

173
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:19,123
Yes, sir.

174
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:20,707
Lift him up.

175
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:23,165
Codename, Donglim.

176
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,624
North Korea's Ministry of the
People's Armed Forces, 5th Division,

177
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:31,082
infiltrated the South in 1970,
sociology professor at Horim...

178
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:32,624
Sir, Please...

179
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:37,040
How could I possibly be a top North Korean spy?

180
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:38,332
I'm...

181
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:40,623
I'm not a spy, really!

182
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,082
The government asked to join the
delegation as a consultant...

183
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,582
I'm done playing nice.

184
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,457
The jerks who conspired with you
have all confessed.

185
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,166
They say you're Donglim!

186
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:58,582
Who says I am Donglim?

187
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,499
They are setting me up!

188
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:00,707
Sit!

189
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:06,707
You leaked the president's itinerary to the North,

190
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,248
when you went to the US with the delegation!

191
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:11,415
To assassinate him!

192
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,707
That's absurd!

193
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:16,082
Sir, how could I...

194
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,666
Restrain him!

195
00:16:19,832 --> 00:16:21,540
Sir! Please don't kill me!

196
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:24,373
He's gonna kill another one...

197
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,374
(Donglim)

198
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,332
(417 Special Forces)

199
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,457
(Infiltration)

200
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:17,248
Gangnam apartments cost $30,000 each nowadays.

201
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:22,291
How's it possible to con $640 million
without help from top officials?

202
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,957
How many apartments would that buy?

203
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:31,082
This country is in a dire state.

204
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:34,707
Are you drunk already? Go easy with the drinks.

205
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:37,290
I want to live here a long time.

206
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,582
I heard you two were well acquainted.

207
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,541
Your husband told you that?

208
00:17:45,624 --> 00:17:47,665
That you worked with him for a bit.

209
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:48,832
Honey.

210
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:53,124
What? You said it was awkward
since it's been so long.

211
00:17:58,332 --> 00:17:59,915
Awkward?

212
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,540
Honey, please excuse us.

213
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:06,373
We have something to discuss.

214
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:08,790
After the last president's assassination,

215
00:18:08,874 --> 00:18:12,207
all KCIA agents were detained.

216
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,374
He was my interrogator.

217
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:19,123
We were together 10 days or so?

218
00:18:19,874 --> 00:18:23,665
The nerves in my hand got severed,
I can't still use it properly.

219
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,457
Sir, back then...

220
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:28,457
I'm so sorry.

221
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:33,249
I shouldn't have said anything.
I'll leave you two alone.

222
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:58,207
Yes?

223
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:05,082
Sorry to call you so late,

224
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,874
but I have an urgent matter to report, sir.

225
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,541
Go on.

226
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:14,416
The North and Japan are having unofficial
talks on colonial reparations,

227
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,374
and a high-ranking official wants to defect.

228
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:22,040
Defect? What's his prize?

229
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:26,249
A nuclear reactor blueprint,
R&D files and a list of researchers.

230
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:30,832
Good, bring him in before
Japanese intelligence clues in.

231
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,499
Understood, sir...

232
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,957
Tokyo

233
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,999
Hello?

234
00:20:22,624 --> 00:20:26,290
Is there someone from
Tae young Corp. in Hakone?

235
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:30,124
Yes, this is Nisigara from Tae young Corp.

236
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:32,165
Where are you now?

237
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:36,207
I can't tell you that,
but we just started moving.

238
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,749
'We'?

239
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,707
I brought my family.

240
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:43,707
Wait, you never said anything about your family.

241
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,791
State your name, affiliation and rank.

242
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,499
I can't disclose that yet.

243
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,582
You have a mole in your agency,
our safety may be compromised.

244
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,541
I'll tell you in person.

245
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,832
Hello, sir.

246
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:03,749
The exfil route is secure,
so please identify yourself.

247
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:06,707
I just said there is a mole in your ranks.

248
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:11,124
I'll tell you about Donglim tomorrow
when we land in the South.

249
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,457
There cannot be a mole in our agency.

250
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,457
And Donglim has already been captured.

251
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:19,957
If you don't believe me, we'll drop the op.

252
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,041
State your name, affiliation and rank.

253
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:26,290
Spec Ops 417 will infiltrate the North...

254
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,999
- North Korea West Coast
- to gather nuclear intel today.

255
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:32,165
Donglim informed us of it last night.

256
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:35,332
Approaching Point Gamma.

257
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,624
Spec Ops 417, landed.

258
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:37,832
All in position.

259
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,457
- (KCIA Operation Center)
- Commencing op.

260
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:42,790
If you can't believe me, I'll hang up.

261
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:51,748
Understood. Give us the time
and location for rendezvous.

262
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,790
This is Agent Yang Bo-sung of Foreign Unit.

263
00:21:53,874 --> 00:21:57,165
417 inf ii op is compromised, withdraw now.

264
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,040
What?

265
00:21:58,124 --> 00:21:59,249
This is Tokyo.

266
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:02,373
We received this intel
from a North Korean asylum seeker!

267
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,124
All units! Return to base at once!

268
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:10,332
- Halt op and return at once!
- Nobody move!

269
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,749
We took 8 of your heads!

270
00:22:31,874 --> 00:22:34,249
Stop by any time!

271
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:39,874
What happened?

272
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:42,873
They've all been eliminated.

273
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:50,957
Chief, does this legitimize the claim
of a mole in the agency?

274
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:55,165
We can't rely on unverified intel.

275
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,416
We will expose the truth today.

276
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,541
They're on the move.

277
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:10,249
Find the green briefcase, which one is it?

278
00:23:10,332 --> 00:23:12,748
The gray suit is carrying a green briefcase.

279
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:15,373
Isn't that Director Pyo?

280
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:16,623
You're right.

281
00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:19,248
He's a key player in the
nuclear development effort.

282
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:20,832
Everyone on your toes.

283
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:23,541
This op has to succeed.

284
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,874
One moment.

285
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:31,332
I'm changing the plan.

286
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,749
Agent Yang get the family,
and I'll take the prize.

287
00:23:33,832 --> 00:23:36,957
I repeat, Yang go for the family,
I'll take the prize!

288
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:37,791
Chief,

289
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,540
if you change up now, we'll all get crossed up.

290
00:23:40,624 --> 00:23:43,165
In case of emergency,
leave the family and support me.

291
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:44,040
The prize comes first.

292
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,332
Initiate!

293
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,707
Says who, dammit!

294
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,541
Agent Yang, what are you doing?!

295
00:23:56,624 --> 00:23:57,707
Listen up!

296
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:59,873
We are sticking with the HQ's plan!

297
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:00,999
Stick to the original plan!

298
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:01,999
Everyone, move!

299
00:24:05,249 --> 00:24:07,290
Turn the car around!

300
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:08,707
Agent Yang!

301
00:24:08,957 --> 00:24:12,540
The Director said intel on
Donglim is our top priority.

302
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:14,124
Agent Yang!

303
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:18,707
Listen up everyone.

304
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,124
When we complete this mission,
everyone will get promoted!

305
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:23,832
Trust me on this.

306
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:43,499
Where are you going?

307
00:24:43,707 --> 00:24:46,498
Tae young Corp. in Hakone.

308
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,332
Get in!

309
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:10,291
- What are you doing?!
- I'm leading this op.

310
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:13,290
Intel first, what do you know about Donglim?

311
00:25:13,374 --> 00:25:15,957
I said I'll tell you
once we arrive in South Korea.

312
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:19,249
Spec Ops 417 was wiped out yesterday.

313
00:25:19,582 --> 00:25:21,582
Intel on the mole first.

314
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:24,291
Is this the best South Korea can do?

315
00:25:24,582 --> 00:25:25,623
Open the door now!

316
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:29,290
If you don't tell me,
we'll pull out immediately.

317
00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:32,957
Why isn't he letting him in?

318
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,498
On October 15, 1982, Osaka,

319
00:25:35,582 --> 00:25:37,748
and May 11, 1983, Tokyo,

320
00:25:37,832 --> 00:25:41,957
he met North Korea 35 Chief Li Yong-su.

321
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,165
Cross reference it with
flight logs of your agents.

322
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:47,290
We learned all your top secrets through him,

323
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:48,790
he's Donglim.

324
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:50,374
Open the door!

325
00:25:50,457 --> 00:25:51,873
Comrade Pyo!

326
00:25:58,499 --> 00:25:59,957
Comrade Pyo!

327
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:01,540
Stop!

328
00:26:02,124 --> 00:26:03,665
Open fire!

329
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:38,999
Chief!

330
00:26:39,082 --> 00:26:41,707
The prize and Agent Yang are trapped at the scene!

331
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:44,166
Agent Yang is shot and stuck in his vehicle!

332
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:46,165
What should we do?

333
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:54,873
Wait, what are you doing?!

334
00:26:55,249 --> 00:26:57,374
Get out! Out!

335
00:26:58,499 --> 00:26:59,749
Please don't do this!

336
00:26:59,832 --> 00:27:00,998
- Where's my husband?
- I'm sorry.

337
00:27:01,082 --> 00:27:03,540
Please don't abandon us!

338
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:05,082
Listen to me!

339
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:25,665
Tell them our location! Hurry!

340
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:36,999
Watch out!

341
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:39,873
Come out, quick!

342
00:28:42,124 --> 00:28:43,957
Agent Yang first!

343
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:01,374
Agent Yang!

344
00:29:01,457 --> 00:29:03,040
Wake up, sir!

345
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:04,832
Agent Yang! Sir!

346
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:06,207
Sir! Agent Yang!

347
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,332
Are you really not hurt?

348
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:28,957
Director was summoned and got his ass whipped.

349
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:31,790
Things are tense because of the botched Pyo op.

350
00:29:31,874 --> 00:29:36,374
Also, the president's Japanese
summit is confirmed, top secret.

351
00:29:39,582 --> 00:29:41,040
Chief.

352
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:47,041
The intel about Donglim
being a KCIA mole, is it credible?

353
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:59,290
How can you botch
every op the president approves?

354
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:02,832
Fuck, what am I doing with these amateurs?

355
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,166
Resign now, you morons!

356
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:08,749
Get the fuck out!

357
00:30:15,624 --> 00:30:17,082
What do you want?

358
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,541
Spec Ops 417

359
00:30:19,707 --> 00:30:22,707
was massacred due to your bad judgment.

360
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:24,082
What the fuck?

361
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:28,457
And why give two conflicting orders
for the Pyo op?

362
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:32,082
You told me to retrieve him,
why give the agents other orders?

363
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,957
You son of a bitch!

364
00:30:36,082 --> 00:30:39,165
We lost 2 agents and Director Pyo,

365
00:30:39,374 --> 00:30:43,874
and Agent Yang is gravely wounded, in a coma.

366
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,999
The 417 and asylum ops,

367
00:30:48,124 --> 00:30:50,290
you fucked them all up.

368
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:52,707
Are you out of your goddamn mind?!

369
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:57,291
This is the list of all the bribes you've taken.

370
00:30:57,624 --> 00:30:59,999
Agents risk their lives in the field,

371
00:31:00,082 --> 00:31:03,415
but the KCIA Director fattens himself on bribes.

372
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:10,541
We kept this agency alive until you came along.

373
00:31:12,874 --> 00:31:15,915
How would the president react to this?

374
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:20,290
Take the bullet and retire with your honor.

375
00:31:20,374 --> 00:31:24,832
Won't it be wiser to keep
the money you stole thus far?

376
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:26,874
Park Pyong-ho!

377
00:31:27,457 --> 00:31:29,165
How dare you investigate me?

378
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:34,373
This is a recording of you and those businessmen.

379
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:38,457
You've got a week to clear out.

380
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:01,790
Who said anything about revolution?
We're after reform!

381
00:32:01,874 --> 00:32:03,624
We can't be cornered as left wingers!

382
00:32:03,707 --> 00:32:05,207
The public won't listen to us!

383
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,916
When on earth can you achieve that?

384
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:10,249
After we're all dead?

385
00:32:10,374 --> 00:32:12,624
Yoo-jung, you tell us, is he right or am I?

386
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:14,123
Speak up. Who's right?

387
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:16,873
Let's just go. Yoo-jung, come on.

388
00:32:16,957 --> 00:32:18,915
You son of a bitch! Where you going?!

389
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:21,874
We came here to find a solution,
why are you leaving?!

390
00:32:21,957 --> 00:32:23,207
Bring him over here!

391
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:25,791
Back off... Damn you...

392
00:32:27,832 --> 00:32:30,415
Bastard, how could you throw that at a friend?

393
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:34,374
Stop it! Just stop it!

394
00:32:43,457 --> 00:32:45,540
Thank you, sir.

395
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:55,998
Where are you going?

396
00:32:58,582 --> 00:33:00,415
I need another drink.

397
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:24,082
That's enough.

398
00:33:26,374 --> 00:33:29,999
They say a dictator's pawns are
worse than the dictator.

399
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:36,290
A dictator's pawn...

400
00:33:41,874 --> 00:33:46,374
I don't care what you do,
but don't hang around bad guys.

401
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:50,457
Don't make me regret bringing you here.

402
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:53,499
Bad guys?

403
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:57,582
Who's worse?

404
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:02,499
How long have you worked for the agency?

405
00:34:10,124 --> 00:34:11,957
13 years.

406
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:17,874
The world is changing,

407
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:22,165
but it's still so stupid...

408
00:34:30,707 --> 00:34:32,498
3 years ago, Tokyo

409
00:34:32,582 --> 00:34:34,832
What took you so long?

410
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:37,791
A pun quiz for you.

411
00:34:38,082 --> 00:34:40,582
Wars that take place in space?

412
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:43,540
"Star Wars".

413
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:46,416
A war that takes place in the winter?

414
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:48,457
"Cold War".

415
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:53,041
What's a war that never ends?

416
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:58,124
"Korean War".

417
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:02,832
That's funny?

418
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:05,707
Laugh for once, it's called a joke.

419
00:35:05,832 --> 00:35:07,248
Practice,

420
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:09,957
you're way too serious.

421
00:35:12,082 --> 00:35:15,165
I've been wanting to get
away from everything lately.

422
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:17,582
That's a great idea.

423
00:35:21,082 --> 00:35:22,915
Where to though?

424
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,707
He's here, we're on!

425
00:35:35,207 --> 00:35:38,165
I always wondered where that beast disappeared to,

426
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:39,540
but in the end, it's all about love.

427
00:35:39,624 --> 00:35:42,165
Gotta hand it to your intuition.

428
00:35:45,332 --> 00:35:46,998
Stay right behind me!

429
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,291
Won-sik!

430
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:02,832
Pyong-ho...

431
00:36:03,957 --> 00:36:05,665
I'm sorry...

432
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:08,999
Soon, somebody will replace me.

433
00:36:26,957 --> 00:36:28,457
Is that Dad?

434
00:36:32,249 --> 00:36:33,749
How old are you?

435
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,457
Yes?

436
00:36:53,457 --> 00:36:55,790
- Sir, it's Ju-kyung.
- Yeah.

437
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:59,666
The newly appointed director
is head of president's secretary.

438
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:05,791
Mr. President said,
if the KCIA does not reform, it need not exist.

439
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:11,041
Our priority must be capturing
North Korean spies who provoke us.

440
00:37:13,249 --> 00:37:16,749
$10,000 reward and
special promotion will be given

441
00:37:16,832 --> 00:37:20,290
to any agent with outstanding performance.

442
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:32,457
Don't kill me! I'll do what you ask!

443
00:37:33,374 --> 00:37:34,749
Stay right there.

444
00:37:38,249 --> 00:37:39,582
That's enough.

445
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:41,999
Let's call it a day.

446
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:46,041
What's the matter? We're almost there.

447
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,332
I said that's enough!

448
00:37:51,124 --> 00:37:52,624
Let's go home.

449
00:37:54,874 --> 00:37:56,957
Let the kids sleep.

450
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:10,165
A long day?

451
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:13,124
Get some sleep...

452
00:38:15,749 --> 00:38:19,749
I'm assigned to KCIA starting next week.

453
00:38:20,957 --> 00:38:24,873
I'll report through CEO Choi
at Jupiter Corporation.

454
00:38:24,957 --> 00:38:27,290
- Salute!
- Yes, Sir.

455
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:28,040
3 years ago, Gwang ju

456
00:38:28,082 --> 00:38:30,123
The commander is approaching!

457
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:35,374
We got the green light to open fire!

458
00:38:35,457 --> 00:38:36,832
Wipe them all out!

459
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:55,999
Major Kim, it's been a while!

460
00:38:56,124 --> 00:38:58,040
Congratulations on your promotion.

461
00:38:58,374 --> 00:39:01,999
Pretty cushy working as a public servant?

462
00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:04,874
How long has it been?

463
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:07,416
4 months now, sir. It's worse than hell.

464
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:08,999
Sit!

465
00:39:09,457 --> 00:39:13,165
Do you know why the president sent me?

466
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:18,291
KCIA has gotten too soft!

467
00:39:18,374 --> 00:39:21,874
Government agencies and
press must embrace his governing ethos

468
00:39:21,957 --> 00:39:25,207
for him to relax, is that so hard?

469
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:27,124
It will be done, sir.

470
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,624
Let's go one step at a time.

471
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:34,166
I looked over the reports.
We got a mole situation?

472
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:35,832
Donglim?

473
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,123
It's not verified, sir.

474
00:39:39,374 --> 00:39:43,415
If major ops are failing,
there's an underlying problem.

475
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:46,040
Am I right?

476
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:50,707
What is this?

477
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:54,123
Dates when Donglim contacted someone in Japan.

478
00:39:54,582 --> 00:39:59,082
Yang relayed that intel to
my predecessor after the incident.

479
00:40:00,874 --> 00:40:04,249
Cross reference it with everyone in the Pyo op.

480
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:06,041
The Foreign Unit?

481
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:08,749
It's not my team, how could I...?

482
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:12,707
That's why I want you to do it.

483
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:17,790
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

484
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:22,416
Strip them naked.

485
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:26,707
Yes, sir.

486
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:29,916
(Donglim)

487
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:31,415
(Tokyo Op Agents)

488
00:40:31,499 --> 00:40:34,082
(Chief of Team 1 Park Pyong-ho)

489
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:37,415
Yes.

490
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:39,916
Wait, right now?

491
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,457
Yes, sir.

492
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:48,207
Chief Kim is investigating
all agents from the Pyo op.

493
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:51,124
Must be Director Ahn's order.

494
00:40:57,582 --> 00:41:02,082
Why didn't Agent Yang drive off with
Pyo after making contact?

495
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:08,166
Our West German bureau fell for
a North Korean plot last year.

496
00:41:08,624 --> 00:41:10,040
Many men got fired,

497
00:41:10,124 --> 00:41:13,332
so now we verify ID and intel on site.

498
00:41:14,374 --> 00:41:17,332
Donglim popped up on our radar
since mid '70s,

499
00:41:17,499 --> 00:41:18,999
but he never fully surfaced.

500
00:41:19,082 --> 00:41:22,040
Donglim may not even exist!

501
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:26,791
Maybe they want to throw us off by
planting the idea of a mole!

502
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:33,374
Agent Yang drew up
and led all ops in Japan.

503
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:35,249
He's the head of Japanese...

504
00:41:35,374 --> 00:41:37,665
Okay, dammit! I'm Donglim!

505
00:41:37,707 --> 00:41:41,748
Chief Kim is Donglim,
you're Donglim! We're all him!

506
00:41:43,249 --> 00:41:47,457
You made anyone into spies,
now you suspect your own?

507
00:41:47,624 --> 00:41:50,749
Check your own unit first, assholes!

508
00:41:51,082 --> 00:41:52,582
That fucking bastard.

509
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:55,957
What? What can you do? What do you have on me?!

510
00:41:58,374 --> 00:42:02,124
Agent Yang probably got intel
about Donglim from Pyo.

511
00:42:02,249 --> 00:42:06,707
He kept trying to call the former Director
before passing out.

512
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:10,416
What if Yang intentionally sabotaged the op,

513
00:42:10,499 --> 00:42:12,749
and his intel isn't credible?

514
00:42:12,832 --> 00:42:15,790
Are you implying Agent Yang is Donglim?

515
00:42:17,249 --> 00:42:18,957
That's insane.

516
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:20,791
What the hell is going on?!

517
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:24,749
Who authorized this? You have no jurisdiction!

518
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:28,874
It's an order from the director.

519
00:42:29,124 --> 00:42:32,332
Donglim was part of the Pyo op?

520
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:35,332
I've worked with all these men
for at least 5 years!

521
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:38,166
We got a complaint from
Japanese Foreign Affairs.

522
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:42,165
They want us to investigate
and make an official apology.

523
00:42:42,499 --> 00:42:46,999
If you don't comply,
I'll put you on top of the suspect list.

524
00:42:50,832 --> 00:42:53,457
I'll report to the director myself.

525
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:55,166
Stop this witch hunt.

526
00:42:55,249 --> 00:42:56,790
Guys, come on out!

527
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:57,665
Chief!

528
00:42:57,749 --> 00:42:59,207
Don't you dare!

529
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:04,915
We got an emergency!

530
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:08,332
A North Korean fighter jet has
entered the South Korean airspace!

531
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:23,416
This is the Office of Civil Defense,
attention please.

532
00:43:23,499 --> 00:43:25,832
This is a security alert to all
regions including Seoul.

533
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:27,207
This is a live situation.

534
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:31,791
A North Korean fighter jet has entered
South Korea over west coast.

535
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:58,165
He knew all about our missile
and air defense systems,

536
00:43:58,249 --> 00:43:59,832
so it was easy for him to defect.

537
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:01,457
What a joke.

538
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:05,749
All our security measures are open to the commies.

539
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:13,749
Damn, this is amazing!

540
00:44:14,874 --> 00:44:17,332
It's beyond my imagination.

541
00:44:18,582 --> 00:44:22,332
I found a ram yun packaging
on a beach near the base.

542
00:44:22,624 --> 00:44:27,124
I thought, so that's how noodles are
sold down South, and read the label.

543
00:44:29,082 --> 00:44:31,373
I wondered if it was real.

544
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:36,249
'Damaged or expired products can be exchanged.'

545
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:42,666
Southerners care about the convenience of
people over such a small thing.

546
00:44:45,332 --> 00:44:48,998
It really is a land of the people!

547
00:44:50,832 --> 00:44:52,707
So he just took a fighter jet and defected?

548
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:54,666
Give me a cigarette.

549
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:57,957
This is why I can't trust soldiers.

550
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:01,041
Speaking of which...

551
00:45:03,624 --> 00:45:06,207
Dates when Donglim made contact in Japan.

552
00:45:06,624 --> 00:45:09,415
Strip Chief Kim's men.

553
00:45:20,707 --> 00:45:23,790
Southern cigarette sure tastes smoother.

554
00:45:23,957 --> 00:45:27,040
If that's out of your system,
let's get to the main topic.

555
00:45:27,499 --> 00:45:29,749
Why'd you come here?

556
00:45:30,499 --> 00:45:33,582
I came to this land of the free...

557
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,499
No, not that.

558
00:45:38,999 --> 00:45:41,915
Why'd you betray your country?

559
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:46,124
What?

560
00:45:47,249 --> 00:45:48,707
What did you say?

561
00:45:49,874 --> 00:45:51,374
Betray?

562
00:45:53,874 --> 00:45:56,290
I'm a traitor?

563
00:45:56,832 --> 00:46:00,082
You're just a government ass ticker!

564
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:01,749
You son of a bitch!

565
00:46:03,124 --> 00:46:04,915
Fucking bastard.

566
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:28,207
I can't fucking believe I get
called a traitor by South Koreans.

567
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:37,124
I love my country and my people.

568
00:46:37,749 --> 00:46:42,249
But the current leadership is deceiving us all.

569
00:46:49,124 --> 00:46:53,624
The son inheriting the people's party?
Even a dog will laugh at that.

570
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:56,791
Will you stop making speeches?

571
00:46:57,291 --> 00:46:59,541
It's the truth.

572
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:02,666
What do you want me to do then?

573
00:47:02,749 --> 00:47:04,540
You know very well,

574
00:47:05,457 --> 00:47:07,915
what intel would be useful to us.

575
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,707
I knew you'd say that.

576
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,540
Pay for the ram yun, huh?

577
00:47:19,332 --> 00:47:21,748
Bring me my notepad.

578
00:47:25,624 --> 00:47:30,124
You probably couldn't decode recent
encrypted broadcasts or messages.

579
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:38,791
We adopted Russia's newest cipher
for added security.

580
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:43,832
This is it.

581
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:50,041
We dispatched more covert operatives
to the South for a big event.

582
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:57,624
A few will be in here too!

583
00:48:00,374 --> 00:48:03,540
Use this to reel them in.

584
00:48:06,874 --> 00:48:11,207
Activate 48-hour Code 3 to capture the mole.

585
00:48:11,332 --> 00:48:13,707
Yes, sir, right away.

586
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:17,082
I hate stones left unturned.

587
00:48:17,957 --> 00:48:19,957
Let's do this right.

588
00:48:26,957 --> 00:48:28,457
This is an emergency notice.

589
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,541
As of 20:23 hours,

590
00:48:30,624 --> 00:48:34,874
we are under Code 3 for the next 48 hours.

591
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,415
The director wants us to dig into Chief Kim's men.

592
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,040
I'll get on it!

593
00:48:41,457 --> 00:48:43,540
This is Unit Chief Park Pyong-ho.

594
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:46,999
From now on, bring new intel to me first.

595
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:48,999
Yes, sir.

596
00:48:49,957 --> 00:48:51,957
Chief Kim wants the intel first,

597
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:54,749
and so does Chief Park...

598
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:58,290
So who do we get in line with?

599
00:48:58,374 --> 00:49:01,332
Goddamn, they're at it again.

600
00:49:32,124 --> 00:49:33,332
Chief Kim.

601

(Dead Drop Location Analysis)

602
00:49:38,374 --> 00:49:40,749
Everyone move to the exposed spots, now!

603
00:49:40,832 --> 00:49:43,582
Dead drop A, Sin jung Mountain, 150-9.

604
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:46,332
Dead drop B, Sangbong 481-3.

605
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,416
Dead drop C, Hong je Mountain 47...

606
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:53,666
Chief Park.

608
00:49:57,207 --> 00:49:59,040
Over here! Here!

609
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:15,791
There was a delivery mishap case of
$60,000 at police department.

610
00:50:16,207 --> 00:50:20,082
And Chief Kim transferred
the investigation to our agency,

611
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:21,707
but the suspect never arrived here.

612
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:23,624
Where was the money headed?

613
00:50:23,707 --> 00:50:27,457
A military supply contractor called Jupiter Corp.

614
00:50:27,749 --> 00:50:30,582
Should I dig further?

615
00:50:33,582 --> 00:50:36,457
This arrived as soon as
the president signed off on it.

616
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:39,249
So when is the president leaving for Japan?

617
00:50:39,332 --> 00:50:40,373
On the 6th next month.

618
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:43,248
What if the plan fails again, like in Washington?

619
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,498
I'll take care of it myself.

620
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:49,124
The pro-democracy movement is
spreading to the general public.

621
00:50:49,207 --> 00:50:53,373
If they declare martial law again,
it won't be easy for us to mobilize.

622
00:50:53,457 --> 00:50:55,957
I agree with that.

623
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:57,582
Let's proceed.

624
00:50:57,666 --> 00:51:01,082
The 6th next month in Tokyo. Let's do it then.

625
00:51:06,624 --> 00:51:10,415
Thanks to ongoing support from the military,

626
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:13,874
Jupiter Corp grew exponentially to
a medium size enterprise.

627
00:51:13,957 --> 00:51:17,165
Let's all raise a glass to that.

628
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:21,748
When I say 'We are', shout 'family!'

629
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:24,623
- We are!
- Family!

630
00:51:26,874 --> 00:51:28,749
Thank you, thank you.

631
00:51:50,582 --> 00:51:52,748
A bicycle heading in.

632
00:51:56,832 --> 00:51:58,998
Black poncho confirmed.

638
00:52:38,082 --> 00:52:41,457
It's been 20 minutes, and no contacts so far.

639
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:44,041
How many inside?

640
00:52:44,124 --> 00:52:46,290
No one went in, sir.

641
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:50,165
Good, we move in immediately.

642
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,290

652
00:55:55,457 --> 00:55:59,748
Jupiter's military transactions
went up by 600% in 2 years.

653
00:55:59,749 --> 00:56:02,124
Chief Kim seems closely involved
with the organization.

654
00:56:02,249 --> 00:56:06,749
If we get a ledger from Jupiter Corp,
we may find something.

655

Also...

656
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:16,791
Kim has widened the investigation to
anyone who flew out of the country,

00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:20,624
and in it,

658
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:23,749
he included you as his next target.

659
00:56:27,624 --> 00:56:29,749
Kim Jung-do, that son of a bitch.

660
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:33,166
We hit Jupiter Corp today.

661
00:56:39,624 --> 00:56:41,374
Arrest CEO Choi first!

662
00:56:41,457 --> 00:56:43,415
Search everything!

663
00:56:46,332 --> 00:56:48,123
Who are you?!

664
00:56:48,249 --> 00:56:50,124
Where are you from?

665
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:51,999
The KCIA, asshole!

666
00:56:52,082 --> 00:56:53,373
Arrest this fucker.

667
00:57:00,832 --> 00:57:02,415
Push through!

668
00:57:04,749 --> 00:57:07,040
Burn them all!

669
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:21,166
Who are you?!

670
00:57:22,874 --> 00:57:24,832
Who the hell are you?!

671
00:57:25,874 --> 00:57:27,290
Don't move!

672
00:57:27,374 --> 00:57:29,040
Let go of me, asshole!

673
00:57:30,707 --> 00:57:32,415
CEO Choi,

674
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:35,165
you know Chief Kim Jung-do, right?

675
00:57:35,249 --> 00:57:38,124
What? Who are you people?

676
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:41,249
You supplied the military
since 1980 with his help.

677
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:44,707
I don't know! I don't fucking know!

678
00:57:50,749 --> 00:57:52,999
(Peaceful Revolution #1)

679
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:02,166
A call from the President's Office.

680
00:58:02,207 --> 00:58:05,373
The Japan summit is cancelled
due to Laundry incident,

681
00:58:05,707 --> 00:58:08,457
but the president's Asia tour will proceed, sir.

682
00:58:09,832 --> 00:58:12,332
This is very serious.

683
00:58:12,624 --> 00:58:14,915
If something so top secret was leaked,

684
00:58:14,999 --> 00:58:17,832
it means the mole is a high-ranking officer.

685
00:58:18,082 --> 00:58:21,123
Agent Yang was in charge of the Pyo op,

686
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:24,040
but Park tried to take over and ruined it.

687
00:58:24,124 --> 00:58:27,374
I hear he's digging up dirt on you.

688
00:58:29,749 --> 00:58:32,457
He raided a military supplier
called Jupiter Corp today,

689
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:36,166
and arrested its CEO,
but hasn't brought him here.

690
00:58:36,499 --> 00:58:40,415
He may try to make it
seem like Donglim is in our unit.

691
00:58:41,124 --> 00:58:43,790
Sir, we can't just sit and watch.

692
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:46,374
We have to strike first.

693
00:58:50,249 --> 00:58:54,040
Put 24/7 surveillance on Park immediately.

694
00:59:05,082 --> 00:59:06,457
Begin.

695
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:08,874
Keep going until you hear Kim Jung-do's name.

696
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:10,582
Son of a bitch!

697
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:37,499
The president's Japan Simmit has been cancelled.

698
00:59:37,624 --> 00:59:39,749
Abort all ops.

699
00:59:39,999 --> 00:59:44,290
Before that,
KCIA's Chief Park took Mr. Choi away.

700
00:59:44,374 --> 00:59:46,874
I know, just stop all active ops.

701
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:49,290
I'll take out Park Pyong-ho.

702
00:59:49,874 --> 00:59:53,207
No, not Park. Take out CEO Choi.

703
01:00:04,874 --> 01:00:06,290
What did you say?!

704
01:00:06,374 --> 01:00:07,999
CEO Choi won't be able to
withstand the torture.

705
01:00:08,082 --> 01:00:09,165
How dare you?!

706
01:00:09,207 --> 01:00:12,332
If he blows our cover, we'll all be in danger.

707
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:01,749
You met them too.

708
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:05,999
They were taken in 2 weeks ago,
please help.

709
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:08,165
You said it was an emergency,

710
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:10,332
and ask about this petty thing?

711
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,916
Petty?

712
01:01:12,707 --> 01:01:16,248
Their families don't know if
they're alive or dead...

713
01:01:16,499 --> 01:01:17,290
Pyong-ho!

714
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:18,665
What is wrong with you?!

715
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:21,457
You know what happens when they take you away.

716
01:01:21,749 --> 01:01:24,124
If you're going to act up, don't call me.

717
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:46,166
You two, grab the honey pot!

718
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:49,916
Name, Harada Hitomi.

719
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:53,290
From North Korea she came through Osaka

720
01:01:53,374 --> 01:01:55,749
and entered South Korea 3 years ago,

721
01:01:55,832 --> 01:01:58,582
disguised as transfer student Cho Yoo-jung.

722
01:01:58,666 --> 01:02:00,791
Her father Cho Won-sik was Park's informant,

723
01:02:00,874 --> 01:02:02,874
when he was chief of Tokyo branch 4 years ago.

724
01:02:02,957 --> 01:02:05,623
Cho is currently missing,
his family is unaccounted for.

725
01:02:05,707 --> 01:02:08,082
Are you absolutely sure?

726
01:02:09,374 --> 01:02:11,374
We're going up against Park Pyong-ho.

727
01:02:11,999 --> 01:02:14,582
This is our chance to get him for sure.

728
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:17,582
Let's carve him up.

729
01:02:18,874 --> 01:02:23,374
Why hide that you attended
North Korean schools in Japan?

730
01:02:29,582 --> 01:02:34,082
I didn't want people to think I was a commie.

731
01:02:37,582 --> 01:02:39,415
Is that so?

732
01:02:41,166 --> 01:02:44,291
All right, tell me.

733
01:02:46,124 --> 01:02:48,124
Why did you hide it?

734
01:02:48,207 --> 01:02:51,582
I only went there to learn Korean,

735
01:02:52,707 --> 01:02:54,873
I'm not a commie.

736
01:02:55,332 --> 01:02:58,832
Fucking bitch, can you hear yourself?

737
01:03:00,082 --> 01:03:03,707
You hid it because you're a fucking commie.

738
01:03:04,916 --> 01:03:06,041
Look here.

739
01:03:06,124 --> 01:03:08,957
We got you fleeing from the scene.

740
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:12,916
The evidence we have is enough
to get you hanged.

741
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:17,957
You trained at the North Korean
Labor Party's special facility,

742
01:03:18,332 --> 01:03:22,707
to become a next-gen spy,
codename Chun Bo-san.

743
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:27,499
You infiltrated through Japan
and together with other spies,

744
01:03:29,124 --> 01:03:32,415
plotted to overthrow South Korea!

745
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:34,749
Am I right?!

746
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:44,291
Kim must've lost his mind
after our raid on Jupiter.

747
01:03:49,374 --> 01:03:52,582
There's no evidence that
Cho Won-sik was your father,

748
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:54,957
why do you keep insisting?

749
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:57,707
Detaining an innocent person,

750
01:03:58,374 --> 01:04:02,874
and frame me for something
I didn't do is illegal.

751
01:04:03,499 --> 01:04:06,540
Shit, I went too easy on this commie bitch.

752
01:04:06,707 --> 01:04:08,332
Hold her down.

753
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:29,374
Everyone out.

754
01:04:31,832 --> 01:04:33,415
Now.

755
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,707
Everyone out.

756
01:04:39,582 --> 01:04:42,207
Kim, you're investigating me?

757
01:04:43,249 --> 01:04:44,707
Sir,

758
01:04:45,832 --> 01:04:48,540
how deep have you looked into her?

759
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:50,166
Cho Yoo-jung.

760
01:04:50,249 --> 01:04:53,165
Who helped you transfer to
university in Korea in 19807

761
01:04:53,332 --> 01:04:55,540
The man in front of you, right?

762
01:04:55,749 --> 01:04:58,082
So, you'll make her into a spy and tie me to her?

763
01:04:58,166 --> 01:05:01,041
We believe she's Chun Bo-san.

764
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:03,666
Therefore, she must know who Donglim is.

765
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:05,374
Cho Yoo-jung,

766
01:05:05,457 --> 01:05:07,290
you are Chun Bo-san.

767
01:05:07,332 --> 01:05:11,290
Your mission is to pass Donglim's
intel to the North, right?

768
01:05:11,916 --> 01:05:13,249
Spill it.

769
01:05:13,374 --> 01:05:15,665
You dare to attack me over Jupiter Corp?

770
01:05:15,749 --> 01:05:17,749
Chief Park!

771
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:21,749
Look at the photos in front of you!

772
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:30,332
You're here to topple our government?

773
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:32,874
You?

774
01:05:33,999 --> 01:05:37,374
If you intentionally made contact with me,

775
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:41,749
you won't walk out of here alive.

776
01:05:41,874 --> 01:05:44,249
Even if you're not, you won't walk free!

777
01:05:44,332 --> 01:05:45,707
Why not?

778
01:05:46,332 --> 01:05:49,290
You have to stay until you confess.

779
01:05:49,499 --> 01:05:52,207
That's what this place is!

780
01:05:55,874 --> 01:05:57,624
Do you...

781
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:01,040
suspect me too?

782
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,790
How dare you bitch...

783
01:06:08,999 --> 01:06:11,874
From now on, don't answer their questions.

784
01:06:11,957 --> 01:06:14,123
Endure it, no matter what.

785
01:06:14,582 --> 01:06:17,748
That's the only way I can get you out.

786
01:06:46,207 --> 01:06:47,748
Chief Park...

787
01:07:10,332 --> 01:07:12,123
Can you see this?

788
01:07:14,457 --> 01:07:18,957
Donglim... Li Yong-su...

789
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:23,790
Change rooms immediately, and strengthen security.

790
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:26,874
Swap out security details to our people.

791
01:07:37,832 --> 01:07:39,748
Take care of this right away.

792
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:46,457
Agent Yang woke from his coma!

793
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:12,207
Domestic Unit has sealed off the room.

794
01:08:12,291 --> 01:08:14,499
You should've secured Yang first!

795
01:08:20,374 --> 01:08:22,165
Go! Push through!

796
01:08:40,291 --> 01:08:41,916
Hold them off!

797
01:09:11,582 --> 01:09:13,582
Roof of opposite building, 10 o'clock!

798
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:15,832
Get to the building!

799
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:38,041
Li Yong-su is head of the Strategic Unit
at North Korea's Labor Party 35.

800
01:09:39,207 --> 01:09:41,082
He visited Osaka on October 15, 1982,

801
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:44,374
and Tokyo on May 11, 1983.

802
01:09:44,457 --> 01:09:47,915
We are cross checking all KCIA agent flight logs.

803
01:09:48,249 --> 01:09:52,749
Retired General Kim was pushed out for
not supporting the president's coup,

804
01:09:54,124 --> 01:09:57,749
but Jupiter funds were funneled to him.

805
01:09:57,874 --> 01:10:00,540
He's under house arrest,
so I checked the visitor log,

806
01:10:00,624 --> 01:10:04,957
and found Kim Jung-do in it.

807
01:10:09,666 --> 01:10:11,874
A KCIA agent was assassinated.

808
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:13,665
While under our protection.

809
01:10:13,749 --> 01:10:15,457
What the hell is going on here?

810
01:10:15,499 --> 01:10:19,999
We've captured a female spy who
relayed Donglim's intel to the North.

811
01:10:21,082 --> 01:10:23,707
We'll expose Donglim soon enough.

812
01:10:23,749 --> 01:10:27,332
We're tracking the finances of a
potential spy organization.

813
01:10:27,832 --> 01:10:30,082
We'll reveal our findings soon.

814
01:10:30,207 --> 01:10:32,207
You mean Jupiter Corp?

815
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:34,999
Chief Kim.

816
01:10:35,874 --> 01:10:38,999
Didn't you serve with
Jupiter's CEO Choi in the military?

817
01:10:40,874 --> 01:10:45,374
He's just a military supplier now.
I have no ties to him.

818
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:57,082
Listen you two,

819
01:10:57,332 --> 01:11:01,832
if you want to survive,
wrap it up before the president's Asia tour.

820
01:11:04,374 --> 01:11:07,457
You know what'll happen if you don't.

821
01:11:10,624 --> 01:11:13,415
We've obtained North Korean
Li Yong-su's flight logs to Japan.

822
01:11:13,457 --> 01:11:16,665
Analysts are using 20 IBMs to cross check,
so we'll know soon.

823
01:11:16,832 --> 01:11:19,415
Yes, we'll know your role, too.

824
01:11:19,499 --> 01:11:22,082
Jupiter's CEO Choi will spill everything.

825
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:24,582
How long do you think that
spy bitch will hold out?

826
01:11:24,666 --> 01:11:26,499
The interrogator can't wait to meet her.

827
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:29,540
Why'd you transfer Yang out of his room?

828
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:33,624
The interrogator assured me
he'll get to the bottom of this.

829
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:36,123
Why move Yang and leave him exposed?!

830
01:11:36,207 --> 01:11:38,165
Don't you dare put his death on me,

831
01:11:38,207 --> 01:11:42,332
just tell me how long you were
in league with that bitch!

832
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:06,582
That girl's father was my informant in Japan!

833
01:12:06,832 --> 01:12:09,373
He died during my op and
I've been watching over her!

834
01:12:09,499 --> 01:12:13,999
I don't trust your informant,
his bastard child, or even you.

835
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,540
I'm certain you're Donglim.

836
01:12:56,082 --> 01:13:00,582
3 years ago, military coup d'etat and
10-day citizen massacre

837
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:51,707
Hello, Mr. Kim.

838
01:13:55,707 --> 01:13:57,457
Good to see you..

839
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:09,082
You stay in Seoul nowadays?

840
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:11,832
Mostly Hong Kong and Saipan.

841
01:14:11,916 --> 01:14:13,916
How are you doing?

842
01:14:15,082 --> 01:14:19,582
I'm just a white-collar now.
Why did you want to see me?

843
01:14:20,374 --> 01:14:24,165
I have a proposal for you.

844
01:14:24,374 --> 01:14:28,332
Really? If there's any way
I can help, I certainly will.

845
01:14:28,707 --> 01:14:31,207
Not a favor, but a proposal.

846
01:14:34,457 --> 01:14:36,165
What do you have in mind?

847
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:39,291
The thing you're about to do,

848
01:14:40,624 --> 01:14:42,790
we want you to drop it.

849
01:14:44,207 --> 01:14:46,248
I don't understand you.

850
01:14:46,499 --> 01:14:50,999
I hear Chief Park detained Jupiter's CEO Choi.

851
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:59,291
Leave for the States.

852
01:15:00,707 --> 01:15:05,207
So long as we're aware of it,
you will not succeed.

853
01:15:07,499 --> 01:15:10,040
I don't understand what you're...

854
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:12,332
Operation Hunt Peter.

855
01:15:25,707 --> 01:15:28,082
I didn't want to report this at the office

856
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:31,791
This is a conversation between
General Kim and Chief Kim

857
01:15:31,874 --> 01:15:34,749
before he started working at the agency.

858
01:15:34,832 --> 01:15:39,040
It may not sound like much, but listen carefully.

859
01:15:39,832 --> 01:15:42,207
Your house arrest will end shortly,

860
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:45,332
and you may have to relocate your cottage.

861
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,166
Is that so?

862
01:15:47,249 --> 01:15:49,874
What's wrong? Don't like the location?

863
01:15:49,957 --> 01:15:51,873
The landlord suddenly changed his mind,

864
01:15:51,957 --> 01:15:55,207
I thought it'd be best to move.

865
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:58,249
Then it'll have to be redesigned?

866
01:15:58,374 --> 01:16:01,790
In a different location,
the design will have to change.

867
01:16:01,874 --> 01:16:05,540
It isn't easy building a small home.

868
01:16:06,457 --> 01:16:07,623
Do I ask too much?

869
01:16:07,707 --> 01:16:08,873
No, sir.

870
01:16:08,957 --> 01:16:11,582
Just a few minor adjustments.

871
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:14,499
Once you complete house arrest,
the cottage will be done.

872
01:16:15,332 --> 01:16:17,373
It's tough to hear it over the music, right?

873
01:16:17,457 --> 01:16:20,665
You can still hear their conversation faintly.

874
01:16:20,749 --> 01:16:24,915
So, I got the audio techs to isolate it.

875
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:26,416
This is it.

876
01:16:29,707 --> 01:16:33,040
It's important to secure funds for extra expenses.

877
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:37,249
I told Jupiter's Choi to come up with $500,000.

878
01:16:37,374 --> 01:16:41,582
He asked for a week,
I'm sure he'll put it together.

879
01:16:41,707 --> 01:16:45,665
The cottage and the design
refer to their operation.

880
01:16:45,749 --> 01:16:50,124
I'm assigned to KCIA starting next week.

881
01:16:54,999 --> 01:16:58,582
Please be careful.

882
01:16:59,707 --> 01:17:04,207
I'll succeed with Op Hunt Peter
in Washington no matter what.

883
01:17:05,707 --> 01:17:07,207
Peter?

884
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:10,582
I had so much trouble figuring this part out.

885
01:17:10,749 --> 01:17:12,540
Peter is...

886
01:17:13,249 --> 01:17:15,832
the president's Christian name.

887
01:17:16,332 --> 01:17:18,790
He tried to assassinate the president?

888
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:22,124
We can't ignore a potential link to the North.

889
01:17:22,207 --> 01:17:25,665
But something's been bothering me.

890
01:17:27,707 --> 01:17:31,165
This is the full list of KCIA agents
who flew to Japan.

891
01:17:31,249 --> 01:17:33,915
Not a single agent was present at the time

892
01:17:33,999 --> 01:17:37,165
Donglim made contact with
North Korea's Li Yong-su.

893
01:17:37,332 --> 01:17:40,540
Chief Kim wasn't present on either date.

894
01:17:40,707 --> 01:17:43,748
You were in Tokyo on May 11, 1983,

895
01:17:43,832 --> 01:17:46,540
but not in Osaka on October 15, 1982.

896
01:17:46,624 --> 01:17:50,457
So, I looked into anyone with a single date match.

897
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:54,082
Also, about Cho Yoo-jung...

898
01:17:55,624 --> 01:17:57,249
You don't need to worry.

899
01:17:57,332 --> 01:18:00,332
I've asked the JCIA

900
01:18:00,374 --> 01:18:04,499
to confirm her relation to Cho Won-sik,
it'll arrive tomorrow.

901
01:18:05,249 --> 01:18:07,457
Let's see, let's see...

902
01:18:08,957 --> 01:18:13,415
Fly in date is right...

903
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:16,832
October, October...

904
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:22,874
Cha Hyung-dae, Osaka, October 15.

905
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:27,541
He has a fly in date, but no fly out date.

906
01:18:29,832 --> 01:18:32,290
Which means he's a ghost.

907
01:18:34,124 --> 01:18:35,749
Wait a minute.

908
01:18:38,582 --> 01:18:39,373
Cha Hyung-dae.

909
01:18:39,374 --> 01:18:40,665
(Real Name: Park Pyong-ho)
(Aliases: Cha Hyung-dae)

910
01:18:41,999 --> 01:18:46,499
I made you this passport for
last year's West Berlin op...

911
01:18:52,957 --> 01:18:56,457
Sir, you went to Japan with this passport?

912
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:11,124
Ju-kyung...

913
01:19:15,999 --> 01:19:17,957
You're the one?

914
01:19:18,624 --> 01:19:20,290
Wait a minute!

915
01:19:23,207 --> 01:19:24,748
Wait, don't come any closer.

916
01:19:24,832 --> 01:19:25,915
Ju-kyung.

917
01:19:26,957 --> 01:19:28,790
Stop right there!

918
01:20:52,207 --> 01:20:55,498
My government has accepted this administration.

919
01:20:55,832 --> 01:20:58,207
What we want is simple.

920
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,207
We want order.

921
01:21:02,082 --> 01:21:04,248
Forget everything, and leave.

922
01:21:04,332 --> 01:21:08,207
We'll support you and your family.

923
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:14,541
The military assault that started on May 18th

924
01:21:14,957 --> 01:21:19,457
resulted in over 3,000 civilian
casualties in 10 days.

925
01:21:21,707 --> 01:21:26,207
On the 21st,
there was even an attack by helicopters.

926
01:21:29,749 --> 01:21:32,457
Youngest casualty was a 11-year-old child.

927
01:21:34,374 --> 01:21:38,874
A bullet passed through his chest,
and killed him instantly.

928
01:21:45,124 --> 01:21:48,874
You want me to accept the killer of my people,

929
01:21:49,999 --> 01:21:52,624
and turn my back on my country?

930
01:21:54,499 --> 01:21:57,124
Your proposal is very insulting.

931
01:22:17,749 --> 01:22:18,749
Hello?

932
01:22:18,832 --> 01:22:22,290
Sir, it's me! Chief Park is Donglim!

933
01:22:22,582 --> 01:22:25,748
He killed Agent Bang Ju-kyung and is on the move!

934
01:22:25,832 --> 01:22:27,957
- What's his current location?
- Heading towards Mapo!

935
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:30,082
I'm on my way, have our men ready!

936
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:31,499
Yes, sir!

937
01:22:46,416 --> 01:22:47,416
(Hunt South Korea's #1 in Bangkok on the 11th,
intel by Donglim)

938
01:22:47,416 --> 01:22:49,499
The president's revised itinerary.

939
01:22:49,582 --> 01:22:52,248
I need to meet the head
of the South Korean cell.

940
01:22:52,332 --> 01:22:54,540
You know cells can't meet face-to-face.

941
01:22:54,624 --> 01:22:57,290
Think we're in Storm Level 1?

942
01:22:58,374 --> 01:23:01,165
Who cares about that, just make contact!

943
01:23:02,624 --> 01:23:05,540
I'll hand this off in person.

944
01:23:17,791 --> 01:23:19,291
People are coming out.

945
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:21,040
People are exiting the church.

946
01:23:21,124 --> 01:23:21,874
And Park Pyung-ho?

947
01:23:21,957 --> 01:23:23,248
Not yet, sir.

948
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:24,540
Dammit.

949
01:23:25,332 --> 01:23:29,290
Follow every one of them! Don't miss a single one!

950
01:23:29,749 --> 01:23:31,540
Follow your mark.

951
01:24:12,749 --> 01:24:14,249
Agent Jang.

952
01:24:14,707 --> 01:24:16,457
Why are you here?

953
01:24:17,332 --> 01:24:19,957
Chief Park, I'm...

954
01:24:20,874 --> 01:24:24,499
You're what? Are you tailing me?

955
01:24:24,707 --> 01:24:27,373
No, it's not that.

956
01:24:29,166 --> 01:24:30,749
Chief!

957
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:50,916
Jeez, KCIA fuckers sure suck at their job.

958
01:24:54,874 --> 01:24:59,207
How could they go easy on a commie like this one?

959
01:25:00,124 --> 01:25:03,082
Which agency do you work for?

960
01:25:03,707 --> 01:25:05,915
Don't play dumb.

961
01:25:06,541 --> 01:25:10,416
Defense Security Command,
you can't weasel out this time.

962
01:25:10,832 --> 01:25:12,540
Lift him up!

963
01:25:16,082 --> 01:25:19,873
Call Captain Kwon at once and free me!

964
01:25:20,249 --> 01:25:22,499
You're best buds with my captain?

965
01:25:23,332 --> 01:25:25,873
Go on, give him a massage.

966
01:25:38,916 --> 01:25:41,874
So? You feel like talking now?

967
01:25:42,624 --> 01:25:44,749
Did Kim Jung-do send you?

968
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:47,832
You think killing me will save Jupiter Corp?

969
01:25:48,041 --> 01:25:51,457
You think I don't know about
Operation Hunt Peter?!

970
01:25:51,832 --> 01:25:54,707
What's this asshole blabbering on about?

971
01:25:54,791 --> 01:25:59,291
Get a whiff of your burning skin and die!

972
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:05,457
That college chick of yours spilled her guts!

973
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:09,124
That you're Donglim,
who's been spying on the KCIA for 13 years!

974
01:26:09,499 --> 01:26:12,874
She's on the way here, so fess up first.

975
01:26:13,291 --> 01:26:16,541
Only one of you will get to live.

976
01:26:16,874 --> 01:26:20,124
Call the KCIA now...

977
01:26:21,082 --> 01:26:22,665
Lieutenant Min! Bring the documents.

978
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:25,874
This fucker still thinks he's a KCIA agent.

979
01:26:26,749 --> 01:26:28,499
Look at it, it's your handwriting.

980
01:26:28,582 --> 01:26:31,957
"Hunt South Korea's #1" Assassinate our president?

981
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:38,541
It's a controlled leak, you stupid thug!

982
01:26:41,707 --> 01:26:43,498
Bring him out.

983
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:49,791
Fucking commies.

984
01:26:55,249 --> 01:26:56,749
State your objective!

985
01:26:56,832 --> 01:26:57,915
You goddamn traitors!

986
01:26:57,999 --> 01:27:00,165
You'll be punished for high treason...

987
01:27:08,499 --> 01:27:10,124
Who are you?

988
01:27:11,249 --> 01:27:13,374
State your objective!

989
01:27:15,707 --> 01:27:17,623
Who are you?!

990
01:27:30,749 --> 01:27:32,749
You did well, comrade Donglim.

991
01:27:32,832 --> 01:27:35,123
Been a while since your last loyalty check.

992
01:27:35,207 --> 01:27:39,207
I'm chief of the Ministry of
People's Armed Forces.

993
01:27:40,207 --> 01:27:43,582
Why's the MPAF involved in this operation?

994
01:27:44,249 --> 01:27:48,582
Connect me to the United Front's Li Yong-su.

995
01:27:50,707 --> 01:27:55,207
You won't hear that peace lover's cries for
negotiation ever again.

996
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:01,332
Our leader changed the plan.

997
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:05,291
Starting with Operation Flare,
we'll attack the South militarily.

998
01:28:06,666 --> 01:28:08,499
Operation Flare?

999
01:28:08,582 --> 01:28:10,415
That's nonsense, an all-out-war?!

1000
01:28:11,499 --> 01:28:14,040
You think the US will just stand by?

1001
01:28:14,124 --> 01:28:18,624
Doesn't matter, 6 hours is
all we need to take the South.

1002
01:28:19,332 --> 01:28:23,457
But millions will die in those 6 hours!

1003
01:28:24,749 --> 01:28:27,415
Our original plan to negotiate

1004
01:28:27,499 --> 01:28:30,457
after killing their president is most practical!

1005
01:28:32,082 --> 01:28:34,832
Reunification is the party's goal, no?!

1006
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:38,041
Do not spoil the plan for peaceful revolution

1007
01:28:38,124 --> 01:28:39,082
Comrade.

1008
01:28:39,166 --> 01:28:41,999
Peaceful reunification is an illusion.

1009
01:28:42,082 --> 01:28:44,915
Your mission from now is to
assist in the assassination.

1010
01:28:44,916 --> 01:28:45,749
(Hunt #1, then kill Donglim)

1011
01:28:45,749 --> 01:28:48,790
By accompanying the president on his Asian tour.

1012
01:28:50,916 --> 01:28:52,832
I cannot agree to that!

1013
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:56,832
You think I stayed alive this long
just to start a war?!

1014
01:28:58,207 --> 01:29:01,498
Having some intel makes you better than us?!

1015
01:29:01,624 --> 01:29:02,624
How dare you disobey an order!

1016
01:29:02,707 --> 01:29:04,748
I can't agree to a war!

1017
01:29:10,582 --> 01:29:14,457
This will destroy all of us...

1018
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:40,748
Get the rifles!

1019
01:30:15,124 --> 01:30:18,124
(Hunt #1, then kill Donglim)

1020
01:30:23,249 --> 01:30:24,957
Back door! Back door!

1021
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:26,124
Go after him!

1022
01:30:26,207 --> 01:30:28,040
You two, go upstairs!

1023
01:30:38,749 --> 01:30:40,749
(Peaceful revolution.)

1024
01:30:40,832 --> 01:30:43,373
(Hunt South Korea #1
after verse 1 of National Anthem.)

1025
01:30:43,457 --> 01:30:45,623
(Intel gathered by Donglim)

1026
01:30:48,707 --> 01:30:50,207
(Peaceful Revolution #1)

1027
01:30:56,291 --> 01:30:57,791
(Park Pyong-ho)

1028
01:31:05,707 --> 01:31:07,123
(Hunt #1, then kill Donglim)

1029
01:31:21,791 --> 01:31:23,332
Free Chief Park!

1030
01:31:54,374 --> 01:31:56,415
Donglim has been killed.

1031
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:11,749
CEO Choi...

1032
01:32:13,457 --> 01:32:15,415
Where is he now?

1033
01:32:19,832 --> 01:32:24,040
The director wants CEO Choi's confession today,
whatever it takes.

1034
01:32:27,332 --> 01:32:28,707
Who are you?!

1035
01:32:41,457 --> 01:32:43,082
CEO Choi.

1036
01:32:52,457 --> 01:32:55,582
What exactly is Jupiter Corp?

1037
01:32:58,416 --> 01:33:02,416
Who are you in league with?

1038
01:33:08,499 --> 01:33:10,249
All right, fine.

1039
01:33:11,874 --> 01:33:14,624
You really want to go all the way?

1040
01:33:22,291 --> 01:33:23,749
Spill it.

1041
01:33:24,624 --> 01:33:27,832
Who's involved and what's their end goal.

1042
01:33:28,957 --> 01:33:31,873
If you don't tell us, you die.

1043
01:33:33,124 --> 01:33:34,624
Very well.

1044
01:33:37,249 --> 01:33:39,290
That's what I wanted.

1045
01:33:45,457 --> 01:33:46,832
Give me your best shot.

1046
01:33:59,791 --> 01:34:03,041
Sir, if we go any higher he could die.

1047
01:34:57,124 --> 01:34:58,915
Status on CEO Choi?

1048
01:35:00,624 --> 01:35:05,124
He was a soldier to the end.

1049
01:35:08,999 --> 01:35:12,165
But the hunt of Peter is possible.

1050
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:15,124
North Korea has a plan in motion

1051
01:35:16,499 --> 01:35:19,540
to assassinate the president on
October 11th at 10 AM in Bangkok.

1052
01:35:19,624 --> 01:35:22,124
What? North Koreans?

1053
01:35:23,166 --> 01:35:27,374
We obtained this intel at a raid
we conducted today.

1054
01:35:29,416 --> 01:35:31,957
Once they successfully assassinate the president,

1055
01:35:32,082 --> 01:35:36,290
we can initiate Operation New World.

1056
01:35:36,416 --> 01:35:40,082
You want to carry out a joint op with the North?

1057
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:40,957
That's preposterous.

1058
01:35:41,041 --> 01:35:44,416
How is that a revolution?
It has to be justified.

1059
01:35:44,499 --> 01:35:45,957
We'll hold hands with commies?

1060
01:35:46,041 --> 01:35:48,291
This is not a revolution!

1061
01:35:52,166 --> 01:35:56,666
It's about stopping the
violence against our people.

1062
01:36:01,457 --> 01:36:03,832
That's our justification.

1063
01:36:08,249 --> 01:36:11,749
I'm flying out to Bangkok tomorrow.

1064
01:36:22,124 --> 01:36:24,957
Go as far South as possible.

1065
01:36:25,957 --> 01:36:29,790
Take the first bus to Namhae.

1066
01:36:30,999 --> 01:36:35,332
In Namhae, there's a temple called Boriam.

1067
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:38,249
Go there.

1068
01:36:39,082 --> 01:36:41,082
It should be safe there.

1069
01:36:42,499 --> 01:36:43,999
What's going on?

1070
01:36:45,999 --> 01:36:49,915
No matter what happens in South Korea,
stay at the temple.

1071
01:36:51,541 --> 01:36:53,832
What's happening?

1072
01:38:37,957 --> 01:38:42,415
Bangkok

1073
01:38:48,707 --> 01:38:52,123
Reunification is at the tip of our barrels.

1074
01:38:53,082 --> 01:38:56,582
We'll celebrate our Grand Marshal
upon reunification.

1075
01:38:58,541 --> 01:39:02,124
The party has initiated Operation Flare.

1076
01:39:03,291 --> 01:39:07,624
It'll ignite on verse 1,
last line of the South Korean anthem.

1077
01:39:08,916 --> 01:39:11,457
For our party and our country!

1078
01:39:12,166 --> 01:39:14,082
To our Grand Marshal!

1079
01:39:14,249 --> 01:39:16,707
To our Grand Marshal! To our Grand Marshal!

1080
01:40:10,666 --> 01:40:12,957
Main gate, sitrep.

1081
01:40:13,291 --> 01:40:14,791
All in order, sir.

1082
01:40:14,957 --> 01:40:17,707
Report when you see the motorcade approaching.

1083
01:40:17,832 --> 01:40:19,123
Yes, sir!

1084
01:40:21,791 --> 01:40:24,291
Why did you let me walk?

1085
01:40:25,332 --> 01:40:27,582
You know who I am.

1086
01:40:27,666 --> 01:40:30,707
You know what I'm trying to do.

1087
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:37,666
How long can you fight violence with violence?

1088
01:40:39,707 --> 01:40:43,207
You think the world will change by
removing one dictator?

1089
01:40:45,374 --> 01:40:48,832
You've seen how this dictatorship evolved.

1090
01:40:49,332 --> 01:40:51,290
It's time to end it.

1091
01:40:56,124 --> 01:40:59,165
Once the president arrives,
when does the anthem begin?

1092
01:40:59,457 --> 01:41:00,707
Yes, sir.

1093
01:41:00,791 --> 01:41:03,499
It'll start once they pass the memorial.

1094
01:41:03,957 --> 01:41:07,457
Once he's assassinated, the invasion begins.

1095
01:41:08,124 --> 01:41:10,249
That's North Korea's plan.

1096
01:41:12,749 --> 01:41:14,957
Reunification by force?

1097
01:41:15,874 --> 01:41:19,290
Are you still fooled by such political theater?

1098
01:41:23,791 --> 01:41:26,582
What do you want from me?

1099
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:31,041
Our goals are the same,
we can join up temporarily.

1100
01:41:33,041 --> 01:41:34,707
And then?

1101
01:41:37,666 --> 01:41:39,707
After that?

1102
01:41:41,874 --> 01:41:42,874
This is the main gate.

1103
01:41:42,957 --> 01:41:46,082
The director, ministers,
and reporters are heading in.

1104
01:41:47,249 --> 01:41:48,707
Roger.

1105
01:41:49,582 --> 01:41:51,498
No mistakes.

1106
01:42:14,957 --> 01:42:17,332
Good work, gents.

1107
01:42:17,457 --> 01:42:19,498
Let's all have a drink after this is over.

1108
01:42:19,582 --> 01:42:21,373
Let's go inside.

1109
01:42:33,166 --> 01:42:35,416
Main gate, sitrep!
Has the president arrived?

1110
01:42:35,499 --> 01:42:37,040
Main gate!

1111
01:42:41,541 --> 01:42:43,582
Go confirm!

1112
01:42:53,457 --> 01:42:56,373
It's not the president!
It's Korean Ambassador to Thailand!

1113
01:42:56,707 --> 01:42:58,457
Stop the anthem!

1114
01:42:59,416 --> 01:43:00,874
Stop the anthem!

1115
01:43:00,957 --> 01:43:02,748
Stop! Stop it!

1116
01:43:03,166 --> 01:43:04,249
Stop!

1117
01:43:21,041 --> 01:43:23,291
The escort made you look like the president.

1118
01:43:23,374 --> 01:43:24,540
He will be arriving shortly.

1119
01:43:24,624 --> 01:43:26,207
- I see.
- Let's go inside.

1120
01:43:46,207 --> 01:43:48,582
I'll send you wherever you want to go.

1121
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:51,749
When it's all over.

1122
01:44:08,832 --> 01:44:11,498
Chief Kim, come say hello.

1123
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:16,832
You've done a marvelous job.

1124
01:44:19,374 --> 01:44:21,415
Reunification at last.

1125
01:44:21,916 --> 01:44:25,249
He'll be a great support back home in the future.

1126
01:44:25,666 --> 01:44:30,166
Comrade, with Operation Flare,
South Korea will be destroyed.

1127
01:44:40,457 --> 01:44:43,707
This is the main gate,
the president is passing through.

1128
01:44:47,332 --> 01:44:50,290
The party and our country are watching you today.

1129
01:44:55,916 --> 01:44:57,541
Good luck to you.

1130
01:45:15,166 --> 01:45:17,082
North Korean spy...

1131
01:45:19,291 --> 01:45:21,124
It's a sniper!

1132
01:45:42,666 --> 01:45:44,499
Stop the anthem!

1133
01:45:44,916 --> 01:45:46,332
Stop the anthem!

1134
01:45:48,499 --> 01:45:50,332
What's going on?!

1135
01:45:51,291 --> 01:45:53,416
Stop!

1136
01:45:53,791 --> 01:45:55,582
Stop!

1137
01:46:02,582 --> 01:46:04,373
Sniper!

1138
01:47:07,957 --> 01:47:10,332
Chief Kim, go rescue the president!

1139
01:47:11,374 --> 01:47:14,040
What are you doing?! Go rescue him!

1140
01:47:14,124 --> 01:47:16,249
Why should I rescue him?!

1141
01:47:57,374 --> 01:47:59,374
Stop it! No!

1142
01:48:01,541 --> 01:48:02,916
Stop!

1143
01:49:40,374 --> 01:49:43,040
Lower your gun. Don't do this.

1144
01:49:46,207 --> 01:49:49,248
Stop! Everyone stop!

1145
01:49:51,124 --> 01:49:55,624
You're sentenced to death for usurping power
and murdering our people.

1146
01:49:55,791 --> 01:49:57,499
Chief Kim!

1147
01:49:59,166 --> 01:50:00,541
Chief Kim!

1148
01:51:14,832 --> 01:51:17,082
Bring the car over!

1149
01:51:18,457 --> 01:51:22,082
Bring the car! Get the car over here!

1150
01:51:29,166 --> 01:51:31,832
Mr. President! Are you okay?!

1151
01:51:47,582 --> 01:51:49,165
Drive!

1152
01:52:37,041 --> 01:52:38,666
Park Pyong-ho!

1153
01:52:41,207 --> 01:52:43,373
Park Pyong-ho!

1154
01:52:46,416 --> 01:52:48,332
Park Pyong-ho!

1155
01:52:53,166 --> 01:52:54,916
Park Pyong-ho!

1156
01:52:57,791 --> 01:52:59,582
Park Pyong-ho!

1157
01:53:24,999 --> 01:53:26,665
Why?

1158
01:53:28,416 --> 01:53:30,749
Why did you do it?!

1159
01:53:30,874 --> 01:53:32,082
Hold still,

1160
01:53:32,166 --> 01:53:33,666
you can survive this.

1161
01:53:41,874 --> 01:53:44,082
Did you want to live?

1162
01:55:18,832 --> 01:55:20,540
One moment.

1163
01:55:24,499 --> 01:55:27,457
Release her. And give this to her.

1164
01:55:35,874 --> 01:55:37,457
Uncuff her.

1165
01:55:58,249 --> 01:56:01,999
Pull out.

1166
01:56:26,874 --> 01:56:31,374
My mission was to watch you.

1167
01:56:31,874 --> 01:56:35,290
Soon, someone else will come.

1168
01:59:04,166 --> 01:59:05,957
Yoo-jung...

1169
01:59:10,041 --> 01:59:13,332
you can live a different life.

1170
01:59:31,499 --> 01:59:34,665
(Park Eun-su)
