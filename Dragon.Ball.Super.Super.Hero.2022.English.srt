1
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:40,490
Do you all remember the Red Ribbon Army?

2
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:46,710
Under the leadership of Commander Red, this evil army plotted world domination

3
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,590
but was wiped out by a single boy by the name of Son Goku.

4
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:07,680
At the time, the brilliant scientist Dr. Gero, who was developing special weapons called 'androids', managed to survive.

5
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,830
Meanwhile, Commander Red's orphaned son Magenta carried on his father's will.

6
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:22,980
Using the enormous funds from his front company Red Pharmaceuticals, he quietly awaited the army's revival.

7
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,550
Time passed.

8
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,820
Dr. Gero carried on developing his androids in secret

9
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,530
and even converted himself into an android.

10
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,040
Yet he was once again defeated by Goku and his allies

11
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,640
and finally killed by his own creation, Android #17.

12
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:51,500
Soon afterwards, Goku and co. faced off against Cell, the ultimate living weapon

13
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,840
and finally managed to defeat him after a difficult struggle.

14
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:04,460
While Magenta nearly gave up on the Red Ribbon Army's revival after these numerous setbacks

15
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:11,040
he was fortunate enough to discover
Dr. Gero's even more brilliant grandson, Dr. Hedo.

16
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:18,150
Thanks to Hedo's genius, Magenta's burning desire for revenge blazed forth once more.

17
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,920
So this is Dr. Gero's grandson?

18
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,400
Dr. Hedo, age 24.

19
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,740
Is he a professor, or a medical doctor?

20
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,010
He holds both qualifications. Observe.

21
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,660
"Carmine Presents"

22
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,670
Did you make this?

23
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,670
Indeed.

24
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,540
His father was the younger son of Dr. Gero's late wife.

25
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,780
When Hedo was in elementary school, he lost both of his parents in an accident.

26
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,590
While Hedo was still a child, he used his inheritance to live on his own.

27
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,770
He was brilliant enough to obtain his doctorate at the age of 14.

28
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:09,070
However, his eccentric personality prevented him from fitting in at any laboratories

29
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,590
so it seems he used his scant remaining inheritance to continue his research on his own.

30
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,560
That suits our purposes. Let's headhunt him right away.

31
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,730
Bring me some tea!

32
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,000
Right away.

33
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,680
Please wait three months.

34
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
For the tea?

35
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,110
No, for Dr. Hedo. He is currently serving time in prison.

36
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,320
Pardon me.

37
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,960
He's in prison? What for?

38
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,900
Well… It seems he stole three corpses from a morgue and turned them into simplistic androids

39
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,120
then earned money by having them work at a convenience store.

40
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,420
I can't tell if he's a genius or an idiot. Either way...

41
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:54,670
It looks like he shares Dr. Gero's talent for android technology.

42
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,660
A-Anyway, we need his skills in order to revive the Red Ribbon Army!

43
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,860
H-HOT!

44
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,480
Dumbass!

45
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,280
Dirtbag!

46
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,820
Are you Dr. Hedo? I've been waiting for you.

47
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,140
How rude of me. Allow me to introduce mys—

48
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,300
You're the president of Red Pharmaceuticals, right?

49
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:51,740
Hey!

50
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,530
How do you know who I am?

51
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,230
I've looked into you.

52
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,860
Looked into me?

53
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,700
You there in the driver's seat.

54
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,910
You watched me when I was out in the prison exercise yard, didn't you?

55
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,020
I thought it was fishy, so I had you followed.

56
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,580
How?

57
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,560
Hachi-Maru, come here!

58
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,150
He's my cyborg agent. I made him by modifying a bee.

59
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:34,500
He followed you into the president's office at Red Pharmaceuticals and watched you report on me.

60
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,340
How astonishing.

61
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,440
Still, I bet you don't know the reason we've been investigating you.

62
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,040
I can guess.

63
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,390
Your conversation was a bit hard to make out

64
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,260
but I managed to hear you say 'Red Ribbon Army'.

65
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,830
Well… At any rate, let us give you a lift.

66
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,240
We know all your favorite foods.

67
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,780
Scoot over a bit.

68
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,780
Fasten your seatbelt.

69
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,630
How were things in prison?

70
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,570
Did the other inmates pick on you?

71
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,240
Some of them did, at first.

72
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,420
But they all died mysteriously!

73
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,490
I… I see.

74
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,290
It's a shame what happened to your grandfather, Dr. Gero.

75
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,600
Frankly, I don't care.

76
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,880
I was still a kid at the time. I'm not sure how he died.

77
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,980
And I never even met him.

78
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,290
Still, by a remarkable coincidence

79
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,430
your enthusiasm for android research is as great as your grandfather.

80
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,800
Research on making the ultimate android, yeah?

81
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,040
Marvelous! That's exactly what I'm after.

82
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,750
It was a major setback to lose such a genius.

83
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,600
After my father Red died, I financed his research.

84
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,000
I get the picture.

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,230
Now that the genius Dr. Gero is gone

86
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,200
you want to replace him with the super genius Dr. Hedo.

87
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,520
Exactly. Well, how about it? Will you lend me a hand?

88
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,690
You can have all the research funds and equipment you want.

89
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,960
I'll pay you 300 million per android!

90
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,970
Hmm…I'm not so sure.

91
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,040
Why not?

92
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:25,720
While it's not public knowledge, Red Pharmaceuticals is a front for the Red Ribbon Army. That's where all its money comes from, right?

93
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,000
When I was a kid, my parents hated grandfather for being influenced by the Red Ribbon Army.

94
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,780
Wow, I never expected you to know so much.

95
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,050
And besides, I'm a big fan of strong, cool superheroes.

96
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,660
If the Red Ribbon Army is still after world domination like in the old days

97
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,300
that makes them the natural enemy of superheroes, right?

98
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,900
You're an interesting man.

99
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,570
While it may seem like world domination

100
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,420
my true goal is to purge the world of dangerous or rebellious individuals

101
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,790
in order to establish an honest society and a peaceful world.

102
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,700
In a certain sense, I'm on the side of justice.

103
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:12,680
In other words, you want to use force to create your ideal world?

104
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,560
Well, I don't care about having authority.

105
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,090
I'm only interested in research.

106
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:24,800
If you're feeling reluctant, then how about I pay you one billion per android?

107
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,510
Seems like an offer I can't refuse.

108
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,710
Perhaps.

109
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,850
Guess I've got no choice then.

110
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,250
Indeed, this is in your best interest.

111
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,660
For the record, I'm not agreeing simply because you held me at gunpoint.

112
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,400
I've injected my skin with a special drug that makes it impervious to shocks.

113
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
And besides…

114
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,520
Hachi-Maru's poison stinger is deadly!

115
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,690
Even for an android, as long as some part of them remains human, I doubt they could survive a single sting.

116
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,170
The only reason I'm agreeing

117
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:04,080
is because I love the idea of having a big budget to build the best androids in history!

118
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,790
Just so we're clear, I have no interest in President Magenta's ambitions.

119
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,990
Got that?

120
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,530
Fine, fine!

121
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,680
So, who's the biggest enemy you have in mind?

122
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,350
It's the group who defeated Cell.

123
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,280
What, you mean Mister Satan?

124
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,650
No, not quite.

125
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,300
He's affiliated with them, but according to our investigation

126
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,400
they are a fearsome secret society whose true leader is Bulma of Capsule Corporation.

127
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,480
Capsule Corporation? The richest company in the world?

128
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,050
I've never heard a single nasty rumor about them.

129
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,420
There's no doubt it.

130
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:48,270
Numerous witnesses have seen flying humanoids coming in and out of Capsule Corporation HQ.

131
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,910
Our investigation shows that these are most likely aliens.

132
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,080
Aliens?

133
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,250
That's right. Think about it!

134
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:01,160
Do you really think they could have created their revolutionary Capsule system or spaceships without the help of alien technology?

135
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:07,810
These aliens are planning to use Capsule Corporation to take over the Earth!

136
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,050
That's an unbelievable story.

137
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,080
I figured you'd say that.

138
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,890
But look at this. It was taken several years ago.

139
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,270
Did you ever imagine such beings existed?

140
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:23,070
They're aliens! Aliens have battled each other right here on Earth.

141
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,580
Most likely to decide who had the right to claim Earth as their territory.

142
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,950
It seems that this is when Bulma's organization was first established.

143
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:36,470
But in that case, why don't Bulma and her minions just take over the Earth by force?

144
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,310
Obviously they want to use Earthlings as a labor force.

145
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,550
Once they've made Earth into a paradise for themselves

146
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:50,090
they'll exterminate us Earthlings and summon their alien friends.

147
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,160
Cell was your grandfather's masterpiece.

148
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,650
He sent forth Cell to fight back against Capsule Corporation and their plot to hoard the world's wealth for themselves

149
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,520
with the help of their secret alien organization.

150
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,500
But sadly, he died in the attempt.

151
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,840
Even Androids #17 and #18 betrayed their creator and joined the enemy.

152
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,580
They sound like pretty tough foes.

153
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:24,220
Indeed. Their organization even includes the fearsome Majin Buu and the great demon king Piccolo.

154
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,640
Is the famous Dr. Bulma an alien as well?

155
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,240
Most likely.

156
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,060
Sounds like what we need is some heroes.

157
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,100
Exactly right.

158
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,980
Can you create androids strong enough to defeat them?

159
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,750
What a dumb question.

160
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,290
I've got a new goal now:

161
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,470
to build the most powerful androids in the universe!

162
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,100
Cool, right?

163
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,640
Y-Yeah…

164
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,080
Alright! The return of the Red Ribbon Army is at hand!

165
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,460
Ow!

166
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,630
Are you OK?

167
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,900
No problem!

168
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,310
Alright, that's enough for today.

169
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,750
Here!

170
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,800
You're doing well.

171
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,270
I'd almost say you've got a better knack for this than Gohan…I mean, than your father.

172
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,620
Then teach me how to fire ki blasts from my hands.

173
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,990
Like Goten-kun and Trunks-kun do.

174
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,370
I've already told you: things like that only come once you've perfected the basics.

175
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,140
Why, you can't even fly yet!

176
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,640
It's so hard!

177
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,910
Of course it's hard.

178
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,610
Bah!

179
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,510
But give it a try.

180
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,250
Don't strain yourself. Focus on your desire!

181
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,150
If you do that, your ki will obey you.

182
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,190
It's no use!

183
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,730
There's no hurry.

184
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,940
You're still only three years old. You've got plenty of time.

185
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,540
Besides, you have Saiyan blood.

186
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,220
It will be simple once you get the hang of it.

187
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,750
Hey, Piccolo-san.

188
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,760
What is it?

189
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,530
Is it true that Papa could be stronger than Grandpa if he wanted?

190
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,670
Grandpa? You mean Goku?

191
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,640
Yeah, it's true. Though these days I'm not so sure.

192
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,980
I've never even seen Papa fight.

193
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,060
He hasn't needed to.

194
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,730
But he will, if the time comes.

195
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,700
Let's head back. You're going to be late.

196
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,250
OK, I'll come back once kindergarten is over!

197
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,010
What is it, Videl?

198
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,090
Oh, Piccolo-san! Good morning!

199
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,960
Say, are you free this afternoon?

200
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,370
The afternoon? Well, I'm always busy training, but… what do you want?

201
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,620
The martial arts class I teach has a tournament today

202
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,950
so I can't pick Pan up from kindergarten.

203
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:19,330
If you don't mind, could you go pick her up for me?

204
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,500
What about Gohan?

205
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,270
He's busy writing the next research report he'll be presenting.

206
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,770
He hasn't left his room in days.

207
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,950
That idiot! Not again.

208
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,820
Piccolo-san, please.

209
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,620
Fine.

210
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,760
Thanks! You're a huge help!

211
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,160
Pick her up at 3, OK? I'll bring you back something tasty.

212
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,310
I've told you, I only drink water!

213
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,610
Oh, that's right.

214
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,680
In that case, I'll buy you another cute stuffed animal!

215
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,390
W-Why always stuffed animals?...

216
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,850
Piccolo-san!

217
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,650
Sorry, looks like we need you to go pick up Pan again.

218
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,390
Give me a break! What do you think you're doing?!

219
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,570
I'm writing a report on insects…

220
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,100
A little while ago, an amazing type of ant was discovered on a southern island.

221
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,770
When in danger, this ant gives off a faint glow and transforms.

222
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,990
Doesn't it remind you of a Super Saiyan?

223
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,160
I wasn't asking about that!

224
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,730
I was asking if your research is really more important than going to pick up your kid?!

225
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,170
N-No… But then, we've got you around to help out, right Piccolo?

226
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,250
And how about doing a little training every now and then?!

227
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,830
You never know when another crisis will come.

228
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,230
Gee, you really think something like that might happen again?

229
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,940
Still, even if it does, there's always Dad and Vegeta—

230
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,880
I still haven't lost my edge!

231
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,000
S-So heavy!

232
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,200
Well? Bring back any memories?

233
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,810
It… It'll be hard to work like this.

234
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,650
Don't whine. I'll go get Pan.

235
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,520
Sheesh, she's your own kid!

236
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,390
I really am sorry! We'll buy another stuffed animal for you!

237
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,070
No! When did I ever say I liked those things?!

238
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,950
Piccolo-san's sure in a bad mood.

239
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,670
You're interfering with my training.

240
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,840
You must be the great demon king Piccolo.

241
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,590
Sorry, I'm just Piccolo now.

242
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,990
What's that supposed to mean?

243
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:10,140
Long story. And who are you, in that cheesy old hero outfit?

244
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,280
Geez, you could at least call it 'retro'.

245
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,010
And unfortunately for you, my identity…

246
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,430
Is still a secret!

247
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,870
That mark… I remember it from back when I was a god.

248
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,120
Doesn't it belong to the Red Ribbon Army?

249
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,620
Ah man, I blew it!

250
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,860
By the way…what do you mean 'back when you were a god'?

251
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,470
Ha! You should've done your homework. Why should I tell you?

252
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,140
Such a tightwad!

253
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,640
The Red Ribbon Army was wiped out ages ago.

254
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,890
Doctor Gero hung on for a bit longer, but all his plans failed in the end.

255
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,690
And that includes Cell.

256
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:59,360
I just came today for some friendly sparring...

257
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,340
but it looks like I can't leave it at that anymore.

258
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,210
I can't sense your ki.

259
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,680
You must be a robot or an android.

260
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,380
Who built you?

261
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,630
So you even know that?

262
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,730
I should've figured. Still, I won't reveal my secrets.

263
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:18,630
Don't tell me you actually plan on fighting me?

264
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:24,450
Bingo! And now I'll have to kill you too.

265
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,090
Don't blame me, orders are orders.

266
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,100
Well, let's get this over with!

267
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,190
What?!

268
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,370
Where did those letters come from?!

269
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,040
I'm a bit disappointed!

270
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,450
I thought you'd be a lot better than this!

271
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,650
It's over!

272
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,740
Oh? Blown to bits, huh?

273
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,010
I wanted to see his corpse's face.

274
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,390
Guess I'll have to follow him.

275
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,030
What's that building?

276
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,650
Oh, Gamma-san!

277
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,520
Yo!

278
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,600
Looks like you've been working hard!

279
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,930
Welcome back!

280
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,570
He disappeared?!

281
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,500
Over there?

282
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,550
Oh Gamma-san, welcome back!

283
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,020
Glad to be back!

284
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,430
Gamma?

285
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,010
Great job, Gamma #2!

286
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,410
I watched it all through your eyes.

287
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,280
Thank you very much, Dr. Hedo!

288
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,400
Still, I might've gone overboard for a mere test.

289
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,100
What? Another one?

290
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,670
Hm?

291
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,570
Oh, it's nothing!

292
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,700
No, you made the right decision.

293
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:46,120
Still, you probably could've struck a pose during your intro and big finish.

294
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,090
I can't believe the enemy realized his true identity.

295
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,400
Hey, you're the one who wanted them to have the Red Ribbon mark.

296
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,870
Did you locate his corpse?

297
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,870
Corpse?

298
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,970
No, he was blown to bits, so there was no need.

299
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,910
You're too lax.

300
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,690
There's no way he could've survived that. You were watching, right?

301
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,960
Look here.

302
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,060
It's so faint.

303
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,210
If that is Piccolo, then it's possible the enemy organization has learned of our existence.

304
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,910
Don't worry! Even if they have, there's no way they could ever find our secret base!

305
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:24,230
And if they did, we could just beat their entire organization in one go! You're too strict, #1!

306
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,500
Organization?

307
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,270
Well you're too easy-going!

308
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,270
"Carmine Presents"

309
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:39,150
While they appear to be merely the enemy's mid-level bosses, these Son Goku and Vegeta fellows seem like quite formidable foes.

310
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:45,170
And they also have the fearsome Majin Buu. What's more, we still haven't seen the true power of that miserable Mister Satan.

311
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:51,380
Don't sweat it. We've now proven through live combat just how incredible my masterpieces the Gammas are.

312
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,350
Not enough flair.

313
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,020
Darn it. How 'bout this?

314
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,390
Demon King Piccolo was a pushover, right Gamma?

315
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,000
Sure was! A big disappointment.

316
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,110
I'd expect no less from the grandson of the ingenious Dr. Gero.

317
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,350
I'm more like a super genius!

318
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,660
Well, 'super genius', if you've let Piccolo get away

319
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,730
we'll have to rush our plans forward.

320
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,470
Don't worry!

321
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,830
Now that I've proven the Gammas' power

322
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:24,650
I can use their data to make as many copies of them as we need in no time flat.

323
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,590
Once we get rid of Bulma and the power of her evil secret society

324
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,840
then the armies and police who serve as their minions will offer no resistance.

325
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,440
We'll be able to take control of this rotten world in a flash!

326
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,120
More importantly, Dr. Hedo: when will Cell Max be complete?

327
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,990
Cell Max?!

328
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,760
Don't worry, with the Gammas here, there's no need for Cell Max.

329
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,900
I asked you: when?

330
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:56,610
Geez, this guy… Alright. He'll probably take a bit longer.

331
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,410
I thought you said he was nearly complete?

332
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:05,930
Cell Max himself is already finished, but it will take more time to complete his mind control program.

333
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,740
How long do you expect me to wait?!

334
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,180
If you'll pardon me for saying so Commander Magenta

335
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:19,290
you were the one who told me to create 'unimaginable power', even if it takes a while.

336
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,840
It seems like you don't much care for Cell Max.

337
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,640
Well, he certainly doesn't look like a superhero.

338
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,340
And besides, I don't like how he's based off Dr. Gero's data.

339
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,620
Cell's strength is well-established. I'm sure you saw the news reports at the time.

340
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,630
However, his data was too complex for us to recreate him on our own.

341
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,140
I figured that you would be able to bring him back even stronger than before.

342
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:50,020
Of course, there's nothing to it. I just think it's a waste of time.

343
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,660
If you didn't focus so much on the Gammas rather than on Cell Max

344
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,830
surely he would be finished by now?

345
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,340
An android like Cell is grown by gradually creating special cells

346
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,020
so obviously this requires a long wait.

347
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:08,190
If anything, you should thank me for effectively using this wait time to develop the Gammas.

348
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:13,300
Enough already! I don't care, just activate Cell Max!

349
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,110
Don't rush it, Commander Magenta.

350
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,910
He's a far greater monster than the original Cell ever was.

351
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,520
B-But he'd be the perfect means of showing off the power of the Red Ribbon!

352
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,060
Still, if we unleashed him on the world in his current state, it would be a disaster!

353
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,770
Why's that?

354
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:37,610
He'd be uncontrollable. Do you really want to destroy the world you were planning to rule?

355
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:44,530
Even without Cell Max, the Gammas will take care of any dangerous foes.

356
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,900
You can just wait until later to activate Cell Max and show off your power to the world.

357
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,320
I hope I can trust you.

358
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,820
Of course you can.

359
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,290
T-This is bad…

360
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,110
Who is it? Oh wow, I never expected a call from you.

361
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,940
Bulma, is Vegeta there?

362
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,160
No, as usual he's off on Lord Beerus' planet.

363
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,560
It's probably been three weeks since I last saw him.

364
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,490
Is Goku there too?

365
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,130
Of course.

366
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,430
You had a device for contacting Whis, right?

367
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,840
Tell them to come back at once.

368
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,340
Is something wrong?

369
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,350
Yeah, I can't explain now, but it looks like something awful might happen.

370
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,700
OK, got it. I'll try to get ahold of them.

371
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,900
I'll have to manage on my own for now.

372
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,470
Oh yeah! There might be some Senzu.

373
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,710
Wait wait wait!

374
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,160
You were gonna go berserk again!

375
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,600
How many times I gotta tell ya to hold it in?

376
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,040
I'm sorry… I didn't mean to…

377
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:25,000
Hey, cut it out! If you sit still so long, you're gonna get rusty!

378
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,300
The world is full of guys like Jiren, and Broly here

379
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,350
and loads of other amazin' folks!

380
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,220
Shut up and don't interfere. This is training too.

381
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,800
You fibber! No way is that a form of trainin'!

382
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,470
You just don't get it.

383
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,010
What's to get?

384
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:55,660
Jiren was so overwhelmingly strong. And yet, his power really wasn't so different from our own.

385
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,930
Huh?

386
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:00,860
But he used his power with total efficiency. Didn't you notice?

387
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:07,350
Even in the midst of battle, his body and spirit were both fully relaxed until the moment he struck.

388
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,180
Really?

389
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:13,590
Such an attack from nowhere can't be predicted by the enemy, and packs a tremendous punch.

390
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,360
What's more, it allows one to conserve stamina.

391
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,100
Maybe so...

392
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,940
Jiren probably achieved it by instinct.

393
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,120
So since I can't manage it myself, I'm starting out with mental training.

394
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,250
Ding ding ding! Outstanding!

395
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:33,660
Truly outstanding, Vegeta-san! I'm impressed you've realized that.

396
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:40,640
You're absolutely correct! It's not training to simply beef up your body like an idiot!

397
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,010
Yeah...

398
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:46,220
Although it did take you quite a while to catch on.

399
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,830
It seems this still hasn't fully clicked for Goku.

400
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,280
I know! Why don't the three of you test it out in a sparring match?

401
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,210
Broly too?! You've got to be kidding!

402
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:02,420
He's a bit better than he used to be, but he still goes wild at times.

403
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,400
If he really cuts loose, this tiny planet will be toast!

404
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,200
I suppose that's true.

405
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:17,820
In that case, Goku-san and Vegeta-san can show Broly-san what a properly restrained sparring match looks like.

406
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,790
Got it.

407
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,250
Whis!

408
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,840
How long have I been napping?

409
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,440
Good morning. Let's see…

410
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,640
In terms of Earth time, I suppose it's been four months.

411
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,990
What? Man, I woke up earlier than I thought. It's so noisy! And I smell something tasty!

412
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,630
Who is that?

413
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,700
This is Broly.

414
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,680
Broly?! What's he doing here?!

415
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,780
There's no way Freeza could find him here, right?

416
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,680
So we brought him along to be safe.

417
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,180
Don't just bring anyone you want over here!

418
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,530
This isn't a hotel!

419
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,770
There you are. Say hello.

420
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:03,000
Uh… Um… Sorry to intrude.

421
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,320
You too, huh? And who are you, exactly?!

422
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,950
M-My name is Lemo. I'm a former member of Freeza's army…

423
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,340
So that's what smelled so good. Bring it over.

424
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,170
Y-Yes sir…

425
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,430
Hey, not bad! What did you do back when you were in Freeza's army?

426
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,400
I did odd jobs, and occasionally cooking.

427
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,800
OK, you can stay.

428
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,440
Man, it's so far…

429
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,110
Hey, looks like you're doing well!

430
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,910
Yeah!

431
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,910
Yo!

432
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,520
You guys are here too, huh?

433
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,920
This place hardly has anything valuable. What a letdown!

434
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,330
C-Cheelai! Zip it!

435
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,080
U-Um… I-I'll go do some cleaning…

436
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,880
And who is this now?

437
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,790
M-My name is Cheelai! Um… Are you…

438
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:04,590
I mean, would you sir happen to be Lord Beerus, the God of Destruction?

439
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,840
That's right.

440
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,170
T-The one they say is the most fearsome in the entire universe?...

441
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,440
You sure are cute…

442
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,380
Huh?!

443
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,410
You can stay here as long as you like!

444
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,550
Wha… What the…?

445
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:37,030
I never expected Lord Beerus' tastes to be so… traditional.

446
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:41,240
Alright then! Never mind all that, you two begin your match!

447
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,600
The last man standing is the winner.

448
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,090
Transformations and projectiles like the Kamehameha are forbidden. Is that alright?

449
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,470
Let's eat first. I'm starvin'!

450
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,370
Well, that's a Saiyan for you.

451
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,710
Huh?

452
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,650
Where's my communicator? My communicator! Ow!

453
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,090
Where the heck did I put it?

454
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,200
There's no more left of the delicious Earth food that Vegeta-san brought us

455
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,350
so I've had Lemo prepare us a meal.

456
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,680
Hopefully it tastes alright.

457
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,630
Marvelous! How did you make this? It's just like magic, Lemo-san!

458
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,230
I put in some spices…

459
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,540
Hey, what's different about it?

460
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,040
No clue.

461
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:38,890
I like it! Lemo-san, you can be in charge of cooking from now on! Whis, you're fired!

462
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,960
Oh dear, I'm so sad!

463
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,560
Begin!

464
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,320
I'm not done yet!

465
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,180
Don't get carried away, Kakarot!

466
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,130
Don't underestimate me!

467
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:57,770
Vegeta's movements are slightly different from before.

468
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,070
I suppose it's the result of his training.

469
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,970
This looks like it'll take a while.

470
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,790
How about some dessert?

471
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,920
Such as?

472
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,260
We still have plenty of the ice cream that Vegeta-san brought.

473
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,390
In that case, I'll go get it!

474
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,740
Then I'll help you.

475
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,810
Oh?

476
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:27,530
Ice cream… ice cream… ah, here it is. Hey, Lemo!

477
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,790
Y… Yes sir?

478
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:32,630
You can do the dishes later. Come eat ice cream with us.

479
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,730
…Much obliged.

480
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:40,080
Aha! Here it is!

481
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,030
Broly! Eat with us!

482
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:17,420
You're so kind, Lord Beerus. I wonder who you did that for…

483
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,230
Shut up and eat!

484
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,020
Whis-san! Whis-san!

485
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:37,700
Come on! Why won't you pick up?!

486
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:42,240
I see, I had no idea that was going on.

487
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,640
Oh… I'm so sorry.

488
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,110
I only have these two beans at the moment.

489
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,690
Two, huh? Fine. Thank you.

490
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,390
Lord God, please be careful.

491
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,960
I'm no longer a god.

492
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Oh… right.

493
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,240
Bulma! Well, did you get a hold of them?

494
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,080
Well, no. They won't pick up at all!

495
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,290
But I'll keep on trying a bit longer.

496
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,830
I see. Thank you, please do.

497
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,000
She can't get in touch with them?

498
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,370
Guess not. It will be tough doing this without Goku or Vegeta.

499
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:23,680
Judging by my battle, those Gamma androids seem on par with them.

500
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,190
That's certainly bad news…

501
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,000
What about Son Gohan?

502
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,210
Didn't you once say he could be stronger than anyone else on Earth if he put his mind to it?

503
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,020
The way he is now, I can't rely on him.

504
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,920
I see…

505
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,430
Dr. Hedo might have data on #17 and #18's weaknesses.

506
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,140
And Majin Buu is currently hibernating.

507
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,140
Which means…

508
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,550
I can't believe it… I'll have to handle this by myself.

509
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,120
I know!

510
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,600
Piccolo-san!

511
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,700
Dende!

512
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,970
Do you understand the situation?

513
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,570
Yes! I've been watching from up above!

514
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:11,450
Things are looking grim. Is there anything I can do?

515
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,220
I've heard that back on Planet Namek

516
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:18,770
Kuririn and Gohan had their potential drawn out by the Great Elder.

517
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,030
Yes, I saw it.

518
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,470
Do the same to me.

519
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,940
Who, me?

520
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,310
That's right.

521
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:30,150
You're the same type of Namekian as the Great Elder.

522
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,520
You should be able to.

523
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,990
Unfortunately, one can only use that ability after a certain age.

524
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,770
W-What?

525
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,410
I know! Why don't we use the dragon balls?

526
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,010
The dragon balls?

527
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,610
We could wish for the Red Ribbon Army to be wiped out!

528
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,030
But I can see your pride would never allow that.

529
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:56,830
In that case, why don't we have Shenlong draw out your potential just like the Great Elder?

530
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,510
Could Shenlong do that?

531
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,580
Probably, if I upgrade him.

532
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,950
Upgrade?

533
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:07,290
Yeah, remember how the number of wishes granted was raised from one to three?

534
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,000
Just like that. Please wait here.

535
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,930
Alright, Shenlong should be upgraded now.

536
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,670
Even as a former god, I didn't know this was possible.

537
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,910
It's because you came to Earth so long ago.

538
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:52,450
Still, we'll need time to gather the dragon balls.

539
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:56,920
I think Bulma should have all seven right now.

540
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,430
For the last few years, Bulma and her staff have gathered the balls

541
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:07,070
and made insignificant wishes in order to keep them from being used for evil.

542
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,990
Surely she doesn't need to actually make wishes just for that?

543
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:14,590
But remember how they were stolen by Freeza's army not too long ago?

544
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:17,990
After granting a wish, the dragon balls scattered again.

545
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,310
I see. Well, it's lucky for us at any rate.

546
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,240
Bulma!

547
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,610
Yes, yes, I hear you.

548
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,810
Have you managed to contact them yet?

549
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,060
Not yet I'm afraid.

550
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,360
Bulma, do you have the dragon balls by any chance?

551
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,070
The dragon balls? Why yes, I have all seven.

552
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:41,620
Alright! Sorry, I know you worked hard to collect them, but could you let me use them instead?

553
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,850
Huh?!

554
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:46,950
Please! After all, you were just going to use them for something insignificant anyway, right?

555
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,600
There's nothing insignificant about it!

556
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,040
…Oh well, if it's for your sake Piccolo, then I guess it's OK.

557
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,040
Thanks, I'll be there right away!

558
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,040
Wait for me out in the garden.

559
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:06,330
Come forth Shenlong, and grant my wish!

560
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:31,510
Speak your wish! I shall grant yo— Oh! Lord Piccolo?!

561
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:40,000
Shenlong! Can you fully draw out my potential, just as the late Great Elder of Namek could?

562
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,340
Yes, of course. Is that your first wish?

563
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,610
That's right. Please do that.

564
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:06,080
Th-This feeling… M-My power… has risen this much?!

565
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,860
I've included a small bonus as well.

566
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:17,230
Now then, please state your other two wishes.

567
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,540
I've got all I want.

568
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,950
What, really?! That's all?!

569
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,950
Then, may I use the other two wishes?

570
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,290
Of course. Feel free.

571
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:32,500
In that case… How about I make my butt a little tighter? Just like a young babe.

572
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,470
Huh?

573
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:38,340
A simple wish. There, it is granted.

574
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:43,690
Then for the third… Maybe I should have him remove my crow's feet again.

575
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:44,860
H-Hang on a second.

576
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,090
What's the matter?

577
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,260
Isn't there… anything else you'd rather wish for…?

578
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,470
What's wrong with that?!

579
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:55,480
Fine, how about I make my eyelashes 2mm longer?

580
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,880
It is granted.

581
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,560
Well then, Lord Piccolo, I bid you farewell.

582
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,820
Are your wishes always like that?

583
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,880
Is that so wrong?

584
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,090
N-No. Do what you want.

585
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:20,270
Oh no!

586
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,400
W-What?

587
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,610
We should've just wished for him to bring Goku and Vegeta here!

588
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:29,340
Ah! Thanks to your stupid butt lift—

589
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,920
What?! You didn't think of it either!

590
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,290
…I'll go infiltrate their HQ again.

591
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,240
How about picking Son Goku or Vegeta for the next target?

592
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,520
We should eliminate all boss-class enemies before they have a chance to formulate a counterattack.

593
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,100
Our spies say they are unable to locate them at the moment.

594
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,850
—Where'd you go?

595
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,060
—I had a stomachache and went to the toilet.

596
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,100
—Are you OK? You look a little green.

597
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,900
In that case, what about the traitors #17 and #18

598
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,680
or that wretched Mister Satan?

599
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,600
—I-I'm fine.

600
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,850
—If you can't hold it in, tell me right away.

601
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:01,550
—Right.

602
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,490
Then how about Son Goku's son, Son Gohan?

603
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:07,920
While he now poses as a biologist

604
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:15,000
according to our spy cameras he is really a terrifying being who defeated Cell while still a child.

605
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,340
And judging by the way in which Piccolo frequently visited his hideout

606
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,690
it's even possible that Gohan is their secret boss.

607
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:26,190
He could prove dangerous if we don't eliminate him now.

608
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:33,140
Alright. But I don't want the world at large to learn of our army's existence until Cell Max is complete

609
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,580
so we must avoid causing an uproar in the city.

610
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,780
It might prove difficult. He hardly ever leaves his lair.

611
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:43,360
Hm. Perhaps we should have him fight here?

612
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,330
Here?

613
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:48,570
Son Gohan's supposed to have a daughter who attends kindergarten.

614
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,850
We can kidnap her to lure Gohan here alone.

615
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:56,990
It also might be fun to watch the Gammas fight in person.

616
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:01,530
I see, that could also raise our troop morale.

617
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:06,370
Even if they're our enemies, I can't endorse kidnapping a child.

618
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,920
Nobody asked your opinion, scientist. Hey!

619
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,660
Sir, yes sir!

620
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:17,390
Send two men out to kidnap Son Gohan's daughter and bring her back here.

621
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,960
Roger!

622
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,530
#15, can you go?

623
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,840
Leave it to me.

624
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,010
In that case, please let me go too!

625
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:27,250
Who do you think you are?! Don't talk out of turn!

626
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:34,000
I-I happen to live near Son Gohan's house, and I've seen his daughter before.

627
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,570
You've seen her before? How odd.

628
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:39,040
Why do you know Son Gohan's daughter?

629
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,650
Huh? Well, uh, see…

630
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,920
T-That girl is also the granddaughter of the famous Mister Satan!

631
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,090
I see now. Still, I'm the one who selects men for the job.

632
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:54,740
#94, you're still a rookie. Keep quiet and stand on guard.

633
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:57,870
No, if he already knows that girl, that'll be convenient.

634
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:59,480
Let him go.

635
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,090
Yes sir, understood.

636
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:09,230
I see… This might be the perfect opportunity to help Gohan awaken!

637
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:12,540
You sure are quiet. Nervous?

638
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,550
Y-Yes. Um… how are we going to kidnap her?

639
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:18,150
Kindergarten should be ending soon.

640
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,460
Most likely her mother or someone will be coming to pick her up.

641
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:26,930
While they're on the move, we can seize the chance to kidnap both mother and daughter.

642
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,570
#79 told me about you.

643
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,210
Hm?

644
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:34,650
We'll be landing soon, so don't shit your pants.

645
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,420
I'll… try not to.

646
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,270
Bye-bye!

647
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,140
Sorry for being late.

648
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,710
No biggie!

649
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,270
Is that the girl?

650
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:48,540
Yes.

651
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,380
Looks like all the other kids are gone.

652
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:53,820
OK, her mom's not here yet, but let's kidnap her right away.

653
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,820
What?

654
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,860
It's just one little brat. This'll be a cinch.

655
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,700
Do you think your mother will be here soon?

656
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,040
Pan-chan, sorry I'm late!

657
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,210
Your mom asked me to come pick you up for her.

658
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:10,430
Well, shall we head home? Tell your teacher goodbye.

659
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:12,530
Uh-oh!

660
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:15,530
Oh! What's the matter!

661
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,630
I don't know this man!

662
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,270
Huh? Piccolo-san?

663
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:21,780
Oh, I'm impressed you knew it was me!

664
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,480
It's easy. I can tell from your ki.

665
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,590
I should've guessed.

666
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:30,320
Then is that man a friend of yours, Piccolo-san?

667
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,600
Sorry for startling you. This was part of her training.

668
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,500
Oh!

669
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,540
She's the granddaughter of the wealthy Mister Satan, after all.

670
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,720
Oh, I see! Thank goodness!

671
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:44,690
You can't park here!

672
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,430
Yeah, guess we'd better get out of here quick.

673
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:48,330
Whose plane is this?

674
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:51,160
It belongs to some bad people called the Red Ribbon Army.

675
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:52,380
Pan, you can ride in back.

676
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,380
What's going on?

677
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,650
I'll tell you once we take off.

678
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,450
For now, just put on these handcuffs.

679
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,750
But you can get out of these at any time, right?

680
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,960
Piece of cake!

681
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,310
Teacher, bye-bye! Oh!

682
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,180
My!

683
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:20,320
Piccolo, you're a real bad pilot!

684
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,030
This isn't my forte.

685
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:23,040
So, what's up?

686
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,900
Right.

687
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:30,380
I followed a fearsome android in order to infiltrate an evil organization known as the Red Ribbon Army.

688
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:34,890
I learned they're planning to eliminate us before we can stop them from taking over the world.

689
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,590
Infiltrate?

690
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:39,800
It means that I snuck in by pretending to be one of them, and checked things out.

691
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,210
Oh, so that's why you're dressed like that!

692
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:49,080
Exactly. Then I found out they were planning to kidnap you so they could lure your dad out and defeat him.

693
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,150
Whoa! That sounds fun!

694
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,860
Don't take them lightly, they mean business.

695
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:58,130
Pretend that you've really been kidnapped and are scared.

696
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,970
But don't worry, I'll protect you.

697
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:06,020
But Papa seems real busy. Will he come?

698
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,390
Of course he will!

699
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,890
If this doesn't bring him out, I'll beat him half to death!

700
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,970
Help!

701
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,270
I'm scared!

702
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:19,680
You awake?

703
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,710
D-Did you get her?

704
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,590
Yeah.

705
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,590
Please don't tell anyone.

706
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:25,290
What?

707
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,290
Don't say how… I got beat up by a kid.

708
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:28,560
Roger.

709
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:37,950
No! Let me go! I'm scared!

710
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:46,230
Papa, I'm scared! Save me!

711
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:47,300
I've made the recording.

712
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:51,100
Alright, show that to Son Gohan and bring him here.

713
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,140
Roger.

714
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:57,850
Hey hey hey. Those snacks aren't for you. Don't push your luck.

715
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,820
Hey, #94.

716
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,390
Yes sir?

717
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:03,470
You can go this time too. You seem pretty familiar with the area.

718
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:05,200
R-Roger!

719
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,410
So, this is the place?

720
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,090
That won't work. Come this way.

721
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,360
Man, it's like you live here.

722
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,800
Who are you people?

723
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:23,340
Are you Son Gohan?

724
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,010
That's right.

725
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:27,950
What's with that crazy outfit?

726
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,050
What, this?

727
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:34,430
…Doesn't he realize it's me? Why not? Even Pan knew right away.

728
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:38,630
Come with us if you want to live.

729
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,470
I'm busy right now.

730
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,510
Are you blind?!

731
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,220
Please leave, or I'll call the police.

732
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,590
Get a load of this!

733
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:51,120
Papa, I'm scared! Save me!

734
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:51,790
Pan!

735
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,370
That's the situation. We've got your little girl.

736
00:52:55,370 --> 00:53:00,080
Come with us if you don't want anything… unfortunate to happen to her.

737
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,420
Man oh man...

738
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,680
What have you done with Pan?!

739
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,850
D-D-Don't worry! She's still safe!

740
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:24,260
U-Um… Won't you please come along with us… sir?

741
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:28,070
Let's hurry! If anything happens to Pan, you'll pay the price!

742
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:29,870
G-Got it!

743
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,900
Alright, this is more like it!

744
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,600
He'll be here any moment now!

745
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,360
Over there?

746
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,520
He's here! Papa's here!

747
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,660
Pan!

748
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:17,470
He's fast!

749
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:18,170
#2!

750
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,640
Papa!

751
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,950
Alright!

752
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,660
You scoundrel!

753
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,220
#1!

754
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,400
I'll take you on.

755
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,940
If you want to save your daughter, then try and beat him.

756
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,840
Who are you people?

757
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:15,680
Y-You've got to be kidding me!

758
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,490
I'm glad he came.

759
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:25,770
Yeah. But that other guy is strong. Can Papa win?

760
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:26,640
Not at this rate.

761
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,370
Huh?

762
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:32,920
We can only hope that Gohan awakens and fully regains his knack for battle.

763
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:37,690
Who are you?

764
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,330
A superhero.

765
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:41,530
Huh?

766
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:59,370
You're no robot. Could you be an android?

767
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:01,440
Guess there's no fooling you.

768
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,920
I see. But why have you done something so cowardly?

769
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,420
The kidnapping wasn't my idea.

770
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:12,990
I merely carry out my orders, for the sake of justice.

771
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,870
Justice? Orders?

772
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:18,770
My orders are to wipe out evil secret societies like you and your friends!

773
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:19,910
What?

774
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,210
W-What the?!

775
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:40,120
It's no trick! So he's a real alien?!

776
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,470
I've been expecting this transformation.

777
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:15,490
Dang it!

778
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,420
Alright Papa! Hang in there!

779
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,320
Damn, this is bad.

780
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:33,830
Huh?

781
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:37,730
It looks like he studies his opponent's powers and movements as he fights.

782
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,670
Is this all the power you've got?

783
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:44,820
What?

784
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,990
If so, then you haven't a prayer.

785
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,550
What was that?!

786
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,110
He's great! Fantastic!

787
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:00,340
That's my Gamma for you!

788
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,990
When I give the word, shout!

789
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,080
Ow! That hurts!

790
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:21,650
Pan!

791
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,650
Stop! What are you doing?!

792
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:25,800
Unhand that child!

793
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,700
Huh?

794
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:50,580
W-What the?!

795
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,030
Great! He's finally awakened!

796
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:59,490
Oh yeah!

797
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,300
This can't be happening!

798
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,950
An evil secret society? Who do you mean?

799
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,020
You people, of course!

800
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,920
Don't be absurd!

801
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:22,140
You took my child! Clearly you're the bad guys!

802
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,110
It's not like that!

803
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:25,580
Calm down, Gamma!

804
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,890
#2, go help him out!

805
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,850
Right!

806
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,020
Sorry.

807
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,760
Don't butt in!

808
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,410
W-What? You're Demon King Piccolo?

809
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:42,280
I told you, I'm no demon king. It's just 'Piccolo' now.

810
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:44,180
Piccolo-san?

811
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,690
Seems you really did survive.

812
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:52,100
Guess one beating wasn't enough for you to learn your lesson.

813
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,370
I'm not quite the same as last time.

814
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:56,080
Don't run away again!

815
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,100
Piccolo, why are you here?

816
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:08,700
I'll explain later! Focus on your fight!

817
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,540
R-Right!

818
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:19,420
How'd you improve in so short a time? Or were you hiding this power before?

819
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,290
Hmph! I'm not telling!

820
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:23,520
Still tight-lipped, huh?

821
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,440
But sadly, you're still no match for me!

822
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,170
What?

823
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,130
Don't you ever get tired?

824
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:43,330
I'm an android, so I can fight at full power until my energy runs out.

825
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:44,870
How much energy do you have left?

826
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:46,910
Still 82%!

827
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,710
What?! Seriously?!

828
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:51,320
Damn, you really are something!

829
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,230
Even with this big of a power-up, I still can't keep up with him!

830
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:59,130
Well, I am Dr. Hedo's masterpiece after all!

831
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,130
It's a real shame.

832
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:05,110
A shame? What do you mean?

833
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:11,890
You're not a bad person. You're just following orders.

834
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,470
So what?!

835
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:23,310
T-That's what we were made for!

836
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:29,030
Your orders come from Dr. Hedo. What if he's been misinformed by Magenta?

837
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:31,330
That's not possible!

838
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:47,800
You must at least suspect the truth.

839
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,400
Shut up!

840
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,910
I've included a small bonus as well.

841
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:43,140
Now what?!

842
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:06,780
Beats me! Shenlong threw in one hell of a bonus!

843
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:08,530
It…It can't be!

844
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:12,560
What are you people doing?! Fire! Shoot him dead!

845
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,150
Damn it!

846
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:21,280
Commander.

847
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,050
Yeah… We've got one last chance.

848
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,230
T-Those guys!

849
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,010
Hold it! Get back here!

850
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,570
Commander, you run on ahead.

851
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:37,450
Damn kid!

852
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,690
What's the idea, Gamma?!

853
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:47,670
I now know…

854
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:49,610
who the bad guys are!

855
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,730
Gohan! That's enough! Stop fighting!

856
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:08,610
What… What happened?

857
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:13,580
It seems we misunderstood each other.

858
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:22,200
What are you doing?

859
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,900
Don't tell me...!

860
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:27,080
That's right! I'm going to activate Cell Max!

861
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:39,340
Don't be a fool! The Gammas are still fighting!

862
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:46,580
You're the fool! This was supposed to be an easy win! It's thanks to you that we're in this pinch!

863
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:51,830
The Gammas are just confused! They can tell their enemies aren't evil!

864
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:56,910
That wouldn't be a problem if you hadn't given them dumb ideas about being heroes!

865
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:01,520
I've been looking forward to killing you!

866
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:19,390
Alright!

867
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,660
Dr. Hedo?!

868
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:31,240
Did you forget? My skin's been modified to withstand shocks!

869
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:41,700
Oh yeah… I do remember you saying that.

870
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:45,900
However, I'm in the same boat!

871
01:05:55,350 --> 01:06:01,500
I'm no genius, but these modifications should be enough to beat you!

872
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:08,150
Now you really are done for!

873
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:11,190
Hachi-Maru!

874
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:26,350
Didn't I tell you? As long as some part of you remains human, one poison sting from Hachi-Maru is all it takes!

875
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:34,060
As a researcher, I couldn't resist your generous funds.

876
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:38,650
I'll take all the money I want and escape with the Gammas.

877
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:46,790
Oh... Crap!

878
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:54,170
What's wrong, #2?

879
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:57,370
It seems the situation has changed.

880
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:05,490
Alright!

881
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,950
I brought along some helping hands!

882
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,830
Well, except for Kuririn!

883
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:24,530
That hurts! I may not look it, but at the police station I'm known as a superhuman!

884
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:28,950
Wow, how odd. Even my brother came to fight!

885
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:30,550
Goten?

886
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:36,190
Hang on, Pan-chan's here too!

887
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:37,760
How old are you now?

888
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:39,570
Um… three!

889
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:42,740
So those are the new androids?

890
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:43,140
Yeah.

891
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,870
They're kinda cool.

892
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:45,710
Yeah!

893
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:48,240
Don't tell me those two are…

894
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,420
It's Trunks-kun and Goten-kun.

895
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:54,120
They've really gotten big since the last time I saw them.

896
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:59,070
Saiyans stay small for a long time, then hit a sudden growth spurt.

897
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:08,880
What's going on? I thought you were fighting with those guys?

898
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:15,070
Sorta. Say, where did my glasses go? I can't see too well.

899
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:18,480
Does your eyesight get better when you transform?

900
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:36,470
By the way Piccolo-san, what happened to you back there?

901
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:42,560
It was incredible! You turned orange and your ki went through the roof.

902
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:47,590
Orange? Huh, I couldn't tell.

903
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:51,410
In short, you might say I've awakened just like you.

904
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:53,740
You looked super cool, Piccolo-san!

905
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:57,510
You should give it a name, like with Super Saiyan.

906
01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:00,830
A name? Why bother?

907
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:03,830
Oh well, I suppose if I did give it a name, it'd be… Orange Piccolo.

908
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,970
Orange Piccolo…?

909
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:52,400
What's that?

910
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:08,160
It's Cell… Cell Max is active!

911
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,070
Cell Max?

912
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,280
Doctor!

913
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,820
W-What is that?!

914
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,300
No way! It's a huge Cell!

915
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:05,070
D-Damn it!

916
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:06,270
#2!

917
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:09,920
Let's do this!

918
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:17,760
Let's go too!

919
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,830
You mean… all of us?

920
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,740
Gohan! Here's a Senzu!

921
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,150
H-Hang on!

922
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:31,430
How could you drop it?!

923
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:33,730
Sorry, I don't have my glasses!

924
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:36,400
Fine! You'll just have to fight without a Senzu!

925
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:40,480
R-Right! Bulma, take care of Pan!

926
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,620
Leave it to me!

927
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,490
This looks like fun! Let's go!

928
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:46,820
OK!

929
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:50,330
Guess we gotta!

930
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:53,040
Yeah! Go get 'em!

931
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,910
I'll protect Bulma and Pan!

932
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:58,070
You sure picked a cushy job.

933
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:22,200
Don't forget us!

934
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:27,370
Kamehame—

935
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:29,200
HA!

936
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:39,990
Damn!

937
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,300
Aim for the top of his head! That's his one weakness!

938
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,610
The top of his head?!

939
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:50,480
The doctor figured something like this might happen, so he gave Cell Max a weakness just in case.

940
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:51,420
A weakness?

941
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,060
But you must be willing to lay down your life!

942
01:12:54,060 --> 01:13:00,060
Hitting Cell Max's weakness triggers an explosion that wipes out every cell in his body!

943
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:01,940
You'll die too!

944
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:20,780
Gohan!

945
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:27,020
Aim for the head, he says! At this rate, we'll never hit it!

946
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:29,490
Damn, he's so fast!

947
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,040
Take this!

948
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:43,320
Got you!

949
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:51,610
He did it!

950
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:56,510
It didn't work…

951
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:09,500
N-No fair!

952
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:19,090
Pan!

953
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:23,440
Pan, fly!

954
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:35,460
Pan, are you ok?!

955
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:36,330
Yep!

956
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:38,160
Thank goodness!

957
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:41,230
See, good thing I was around!

958
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:47,450
Guess so! But it would've been better if I'd brought along the plane so we could escape.

959
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,630
Hey Goten, let's fuse! We can use Fusion!

960
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:56,200
Fusion? Gee, I'm not sure I remember how.

961
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:01,410
Fu… sion… Ha!

962
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:10,360
I… I blew it! Damn, guess I'll just have to make do!

963
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:13,200
Super Saiyan!

964
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,710
H-Huh…?

965
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:22,060
Rats! In that case… charge!

966
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:30,930
Bullseye!

967
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:41,890
It's the first time a failed fusion has come in handy!

968
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:55,320
Crap!

969
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,220
We'll have to use stronger attacks…

970
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:03,700
Hey, you guys!

971
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:08,140
Keep your distance and fire on Cell Max all at once!

972
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,610
Anywhere on his body is fine!

973
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:12,260
What are you planning?

974
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:14,690
Don't tell me you're—

975
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,190
Stop!

976
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:18,190
Too late!

977
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:19,900
Then I should go too!

978
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:22,840
#1, go save Dr. Hedo.

979
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:23,880
What?!

980
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,880
Check your Life Scope.

981
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:29,380
The doctor's not dead yet.

982
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,560
You're too lax.

983
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:47,290
Do it now! Then once I attack, run as far as you can!

984
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:51,190
What's he going to do?

985
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:52,770
He's going to charge.

986
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:59,040
W-What are they doing?

987
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,110
It looks like they're attacking all at once.

988
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,060
I'd better join them!

989
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:05,890
Kuririn, be careful!

990
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:33,050
Oh no!

991
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:34,620
Kienzan!

992
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:37,620
Kuririn-san!

993
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:38,920
#18-san!

994
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:39,860
I owe you one.

995
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,740
Here he comes! Get away!

996
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:45,640
Everyone, close your eyes!

997
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,710
Taiyo-Ken!

998
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:54,390
Yay! Spanky spank!

999
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:10,450
Go!

1000
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:33,970
He… He did it!

1001
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:37,910
It's not over yet!

1002
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:57,050
Stop!

1003
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,220
How ya like that?!

1004
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,310
Piccolo, grow big!

1005
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:30,240
What?

1006
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:33,250
Back in the old days, you grew into a giant, right?

1007
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:35,360
At the Tenkaichi Budokai!

1008
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:39,930
That's right! I'd forgotten!

1009
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,550
Yeah!

1010
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:10,220
Piccolo-san, can you beat him now that you're so big?

1011
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:11,960
It's not that simple.

1012
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:16,870
Although I'm bigger, my strength's not much different than before. This is just a bluff.

1013
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:18,870
I know!

1014
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:22,380
Hm? It's hard to find it when I'm this size.

1015
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:24,360
There it is!

1016
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:28,590
It's the Senzu I was planning to eat. You can have it.

1017
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:31,330
You didn't eat it earlier?

1018
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:34,280
Then you should take it.

1019
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,310
Just eat it!

1020
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:36,610
But…

1021
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:38,480
I've got a plan.

1022
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,480
A-Alright.

1023
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:54,120
Gohan, listen up!

1024
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:57,990
If you put your mind to it, you could be the strongest in this world.

1025
01:20:57,990 --> 01:21:02,220
Believe in yourself, and cut loose!

1026
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:05,200
Let me see your true power!

1027
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:08,240
And use it to save the world!

1028
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:08,970
I will!

1029
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:11,810
Here goes!

1030
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:04,790
Damn it! You guys, get over here!

1031
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,660
Gohan!

1032
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:12,430
Yes!

1033
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:15,710
I'll knock that bastard to the ground!

1034
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:19,180
Once you see your chance, use a Kamehameha or something.

1035
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:22,920
Charge up all the power you can and then pierce through his head!

1036
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,620
U-Understood!

1037
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,230
All the power you can manage!

1038
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:30,540
Don't hold back! Pack everything into this one attack!

1039
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:31,600
Yes!

1040
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,600
Here he comes.

1041
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,270
Gohan!

1042
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:49,210
Right!

1043
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,850
Piccolo-san!

1044
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,550
Stay away!

1045
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:11,650
Concentrate your ki!

1046
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:15,800
The real battle… begins now!

1047
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:28,220
Gohan, aren't you ready yet?!

1048
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:30,320
Piccolo's gonna die!

1049
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,020
Just a… little more…

1050
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:41,340
You idiot!

1051
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:01,380
Damn it…

1052
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:05,530
If I don't stop him…

1053
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:22,660
At this rate, Piccolo-san will…

1054
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:24,060
Hold it!

1055
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:27,170
I swear… I'll stop… him…

1056
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,840
That all you got?

1057
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:55,920
Now it's my turn!

1058
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,340
Gohan!

1059
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:07,530
Simmer down!

1060
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:15,980
Gohan! Fire!

1061
01:27:18,450 --> 01:27:23,920
Makankosappo!

1062
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:03,770
He did it! He really did it!

1063
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:06,610
He's gonna blow! Get away!

1064
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:31,990
Thank goodness we got away in time.

1065
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:34,860
Oh, that monster is gone.

1066
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:37,110
I wonder if everyone's OK.

1067
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,710
Looks like they're all safe.

1068
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,430
You look good orange.

1069
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:11,170
You're quite a sight yourself. Oh?

1070
01:29:11,770 --> 01:29:12,430
Yikes!

1071
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:45,270
We never could have won without their help.

1072
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:50,520
Even Dad or Vegeta might not have been able to beat that Cell monster.

1073
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:54,190
That's why I told you never to let your guard down, even when things seem peaceful.

1074
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:57,090
You were right! I'm sorry.

1075
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:00,230
By the way, just now you fired a—

1076
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:03,300
It was supposed to be a Makankosappo.

1077
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,440
When did you learn that?

1078
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:09,250
I've been practicing in secret.

1079
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,090
It was marvelous.

1080
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:40,850
Is he dead?

1081
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:42,320
Yes.

1082
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:46,120
I tried to save him, but it was no use.

1083
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:49,270
What did he do back there?

1084
01:30:50,970 --> 01:30:53,740
He used up all his remaining energy in one burst.

1085
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:57,040
Thanks to him, Cell's attack power dropped.

1086
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:02,760
He was a superhero.

1087
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:05,890
You people are the real heroes.

1088
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:09,370
Thank you. You saved the world.

1089
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:11,940
#2 is the one you should thank.

1090
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:13,710
It's all my fault.

1091
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:16,580
I'm the one who created Cell Max.

1092
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:19,090
#2 took responsibility for my mistakes.

1093
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:23,300
Weren't you just being used?

1094
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,730
No, somehow I could tell what was really going on.

1095
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:28,180
I just wanted their research funds.

1096
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:32,820
Still, I'm amazed you survived.

1097
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:37,360
I've modified my skin to endure small shocks.

1098
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:41,000
You modified your skin?! That's kinda creepy!

1099
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,240
How's that any different from getting rid of crow's feet?

1100
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,540
That was Trunks talking, wasn't it?!

1101
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:51,790
By the way Goten-kun, could you keep today a secret from Chi-Chi?

1102
01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:55,160
If she found out I invited you to this battle, she'd kill me!

1103
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:55,930
You got it!

1104
01:31:55,930 --> 01:32:00,470
Your name was Dr. Hedo, wasn't it? What will you do now?

1105
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:06,650
Gamma and I will turn ourselves in to the police.

1106
01:32:06,650 --> 01:32:09,390
N-N-No! You've gotta be kidding!

1107
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:12,630
The cops wouldn't know what to do with you!

1108
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:16,600
Why not just pretend this all never happened?

1109
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:21,350
You guys weren't good, but you weren't evil either.

1110
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:24,290
Then…

1111
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:28,590
Would you let me and Gamma work at Capsule Corporation?

1112
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:33,040
Huh?! No way! How dare you ask that?!

1113
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,410
…Say, are you any good with cosmetics?

1114
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:37,580
Cosmetics?

1115
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:38,620
Come over here.

1116
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:44,660
Like, could you make skin look younger?

1117
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:49,240
Well… obviously I know all about biology

1118
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,240
and I have a medical license as well

1119
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,810
so that should be simple.

1120
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:54,080
I see.

1121
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:58,080
Your amazing abilities are perfect for our company.

1122
01:32:58,090 --> 01:33:00,930
Plus you've got an outstanding bodyguard.

1123
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:05,470
And I certainly don't want to let you go off and plot more evil schemes.

1124
01:33:05,470 --> 01:33:07,030
What do you say, Piccolo?

1125
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:08,600
I've got no objection.

1126
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:12,550
And it means you won't have to use the dragon balls for that crap anymore. Right?

1127
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:16,220
Shut it! OK, that settles it! You're hired!

1128
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:17,820
Thank you so much!

1129
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:19,300
Hey, thank her too!

1130
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,570
Thank you very much!

1131
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:02,180
Tomorrow you'll begin the next step of your training!

1132
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:05,350
Yeah!

1133
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:12,950
Alright.

1134
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:33,660
I lose!

1135
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,830
Oh, right.

1136
01:38:36,830 --> 01:38:39,730
Vegeta-san is the winner!

1137
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,540
I… I did it.

1138
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:51,030
I fi… finally beat… Kakarot!

1139
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,870
I really… did it…

1140
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:03,180
Good grief! So they finally finished.

1141
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:05,150
How dumb was that?

1142
01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:07,150
Right, Broly?

1143
01:39:10,930 --> 01:39:13,000
Men are…

1144
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
...such morons!

1145
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:23,410
Huh? Did you need something, Bulma?

1146
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:26,210
Sheesh, took you long enough, Whis!

1147
01:39:26,230 --> 01:39:31,000
My sincerest apologies. By the way, do you have anything tasty over there?

1148
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:36,420
I did, but it’s cold now. You’ll have to come over next time. Later!

1149
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:40,910
My, I wonder what that was all about…?
