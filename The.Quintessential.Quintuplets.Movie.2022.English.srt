00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,170
I was dreaming

2
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,670
the day I met you

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,460
in 11th grade.

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,510
The dream of that dreamlike day.

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,680
Sorry to keep you waiting.

6
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,060
I will call you again

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,230
when the bride has gotten the dress changed.

8
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,230
Excuse me.

9
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,850
Have you seen the bride's sisters?

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,020
Yes.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,520
They've arrived here earlier.

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,940
I see.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,150
Groom.

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,200
The bride wants to see you.

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,450
What's the matter?

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,680
I will finish changing soon.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,870
Wait a moment there.

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,170
Oh, right. It seems they have come.

19
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,580
Seriously, what are they planning?

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,510
They have never changed since high school.

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,170
Problem girls.

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,220
I dreamed again just now.

23
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,310
How many times
will I see that day in my dreams?

24
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,390
Such a ridiculous nightmare

25
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,520
that is deeply engraved in my mind.

26
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,110
Sorry to keep you waiting.

27
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,910
Am I still dreaming...

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,990
- I love you.
- Love you.

29
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,460
- Love. - I love you.
- I'm in love with you.

00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,820
Thanks to you girls,
it's another big victory today!

148
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,190
Especially Yotsuba!

149
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,990
Recently, you are making
a remarkable progress!

150
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,370
Eh, me?

151
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,910
Really?

152
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,210
We are quintuplets,
so it shouldn't be like that.

153
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,920
No. There is nothing wrong
with my judgment.

154
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,050
You should also follow Yotsuba's example
to practice hard.

155
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,510
Example?

156
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,430
Let's go now as the game has finished.

157
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,800
Or the store will close.

158
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,310
Why? Do you need to go shopping?

159
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,680
Yes! We want to buy mom a present!

160
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,480
Celebration of recovering from illness.

161
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,810
We five have saved our pocket money
for this day.

162
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,780
So, let's head for the florist!

163
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,360
Come on, Ichika you are so pushy.

164
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,080
Girls, let's go.

165
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,120
What kind of flowers will make mom happy

166
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,120
when she receives it as a present?

167
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,370
I heard that carnations
are suitable for a present to mom.

168
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,080
Carnations?

169
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,840
Yes. Although I don't know it clearly.

170
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,800
Yotsuba, how much do we have?

171
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,210
Well...

172
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,080
Eh? I might have lost the purse.

173
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,300
Have you found it there?

174
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,060
It doesn't seem to be here.

175
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,060
It was there before the soccer game.

176
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,480
It should be around here.

177
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,730
I'm looking for it deeper inside.

178
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,770
Yotsuba...

179
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,240
What should I do?

180
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,320
It's all my fault.

181
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,200
What should I do...

182
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,040
Sorry, girls.

183
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,960
It's all my fault.

184
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,710
It's not your fault, Yotsuba.

185
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,670
It would be lost
no matter who of us was keeping it.

186
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,340
Yes.

187
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,210
Because everyone's failure
will be divided into five equally.

188
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,010
Girls!

189
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,220
It probably can't be a substitute,

190
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,470
but I found a beautiful flower here.

191
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,430
This...

192
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,020
How about it?

193
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,230
Yotsuba, that is...

194
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,980
Sorry!

195
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,900
I'm just being self-serving.

196
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,940
We also found it.

197
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,530
- These flowers.
- We are really quintuplets.

198
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,160
I'm home.

199
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,870
Aren't you home?

200
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,000
Mom, congratulations!

201
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,080
We're glad you got well.

202
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,550
Look! These were collected by all of us!

203
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,590
Thank you for your hard work
today and always.

204
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,970
Thank you for always!

205
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,220
- Eh? Mom is frozen.
- Looks it's not enough...

206
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,220
For me,

207
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,520
Only if you five can grow up with health,

208
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,230
I couldn't be much happier.

209
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,570
Thank you all.

210
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,280

No way.

220
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,640
The last summer vacation
of high school passed in a flash.

221
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,390
When the second semester begins,

222
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,980
we'll be busy preparing for
the school festival.

223
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,900
Ichika will be off school for a while, right?

224
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,650
Because I have started with the movie filming.

225
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,980
Is it okay with the number of attendance day?

226
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,320
Well, somehow.

227
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,490
Futarou said he would give me private lessons.

228
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,740
That being said...

229
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,620
I didn't expect we'd come back here.

230
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,450
(Notice of Demolition Work)

231
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,190
Demolition notice

232
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,180
(Notice of Demolition Work)
Being evacuated half a year after we moved,

233
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,000
that's so unlucky of us.

234
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,170
Oh!

235
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,210
It's as tidy as usual!

236
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,460
It must be Ebata, right?

237
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,880
He might keep cleaning it all the time.

238
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
It definitely feels better in wider room.

239
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,770
Staff Room

240
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,630
(Staff Room)
Excuse me.

241
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,650
(Staff Room)

242
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,230
Excuse me.

243
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,650
Ah, Itsuki.

244
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,400
What did you do in the staff room?

245
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,070
Something I can't understand
about today's class.

246
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,910
- I came to ask...
- I see!

247
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,240
I came for the school festival.

248
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,410
29th ASAHI SCHOOL FESTIVAL

249
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,410
13

250
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,410
15

251
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,410
The Sunrise

252
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,410
Fest

253
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,410
OCTOBER   (SAT) --   (MON)

254
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,880
(The 29th School Festival of Asahi Senior School)
Seems the class president

255
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,790
(The 29th School Festival of Asahi Senior School)
will take the lead in making all decisions.

256
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,250
(Sunrise Festival)
Eh? Class president means...

257
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,630
I wonder how Uesugi

258
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,880
would arrange this festival.

259
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,510
Anyway,

260
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,590
the third graders have a custom of stalls.

261
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,970
Fried chicken with Frankfurt.

262
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,970
Potato with butter is also good.

263
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,930
I'm sorry.

264
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,730
Save this topic for next time.

265
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,060
It's almost time for helping
in the cram school.

266
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,950
Hum. I thought Itsuki took eating
as the most important.

267
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,910
Everyone should have left...

268
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,580
Eh?

269
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,450
What's the matter, Yotsuba?

270
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry to interrupt
while you're studying.

271
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,340
Well...

272
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,590
Is it about the stalls
at the school festival?

273
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,550
Wait a moment.

274
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,970
I can't waste a second now.

275
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,800
Okay...

276
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,910
Raiha told me.

277
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,700
I have watched Ichika's commercial...

278
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,980
Don't forget it. It will be given in summer.

279
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,800
Vitamin Stimulus

280
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,620
(Vitamin Stimulation
METCH)

281
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,140
She's completely an actress.

282
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,890
She should have realized her dream.

283
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,390
Itsuki also wants to become a teacher.

284
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,230
It seems she has a dream
beyond her means.

285
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,070
- Yotsuba.
- Yes?

286
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,780
Do you have something
you want to become for the future?

287
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,650
Eh?

288
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,070
It's all of a sudden.

289
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,070
Well.

290
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,330
I haven't thought about it.

291
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,080
Well.

292
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,250
You have the outstanding physical ability.

293
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,590
You have a lot of choices in that direction.

294
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,840
Sorry to keep you waiting.

295
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,260
Let's go around to get the information
about the stalls last year.

296
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,220
Huh.

297
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,220
But is it okay?

298
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,100
Uesugi, you said
you couldn't waste time...

299
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,270
That's why I'm doing so.

300
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,640
It's the last school event.

301
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,480
I won't waste any bit of it.

302
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,610
I've decided to enjoy it thoroughly
since I've chosen to do it.

303
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,190
The time is limited.

304
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,860
I could never have it enough.

305
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,240
I'll be counting on you.

306
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,200
Yes! Leave it to me!

307
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,750
(6. Rice cracker 5. Churro 4. Frankfurt)

308
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,710
(3. Fried chicken 2. Chocolate banana 1. Takoyaki)
This is the list of popular stalls last year.

309
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,420
If anyone who has ideas other than these,

310
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,310
1. Takoyaki
2. Choco-Bananas
3. Skewered Chicken
4. Sausages
5. Churros
6. Octopus Crackers

311
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,000
tell us any time you like.

312
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,420
I cast a vote for Takoyaki.

313
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,510
Let's stick to norms this way.

314
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,350
What's more, you have investigated
about this list, right?

315
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,890
If we go with Takoyaki, I will show you

316
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,640
my skills polished by my part-time job.

317
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,190
It sounds fun.

318
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,860
Anything else?

319
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,150
- Taiyaki!
- Bubble Tea!

320
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,240
Miku, do you have any idea?

321
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,820
Eh?

322
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,410
Pancake.

323
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,830
Well...

324
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,370
It's not in the data by last year.

325
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,580
But there can be.

326
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,670
Nice idea.

327
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,130
Miku, thank you.

328
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,840
I also think it's a good idea.

329
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,460
It will definitely look cute!

330
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,720
That's all for today. We'll discuss later.

331
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,600
Nakano.

332
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,350
Can we take part in the live stage?

333
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,690
Of course!

334
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,110
Clothing club offered this.

335
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,110
Will the customers come...

336
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,190
Wow! Amazing!

337
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,740
We can put a poster
in the designated place.

338
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,820
Please allow us to help you.

339
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,080
Thank you!

340
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,990
- Yotsuba is so popular.
- No, no.

341
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,290
Why is no one coming to me?

342
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,370
Popularity.

343
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,670
I want to send invitations to my relatives.

344
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,040
I have prepared!

345
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,880
Invitations...

346
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,250
Anyway, the stalls.

347
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,090
(Taiyaki, Bubble Tea, Pancake)
Anyway, the stalls.

348
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,270
1. Takoyaki
2. Choco-Bananas
3. Skewered Chicken
4. Sausages
5. Churros
6. Octopus Crackers

349
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,270
Taiyaki
Bubble tea
Pancakes

350
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,170
(Taiyaki, Bubble Tea, Pancake)
No matter what we do,

351
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,420
I'm burning to try my hand at it.

352
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,180
Yes. I'm itching to show
what I can do.

353
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,720
Eh?

354
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,100
You want to be in charge of cooking?

355
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,310
There will be some customers
from outside too.

356
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,430
If you're not good at it,
you'll be food poisoning the local residents.

357
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,690
I'm getting better.

358
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,270
And you're there.

359
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,940
So I'm not worried.

360
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,700
O...Of course.

361
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,360
If you cook with me,

362
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,620
there is no chance of failure.

363
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,450
Sorry to keep you waiting.

364
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,620
Good job.

365
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,450
Aren't you working a bit too hard?

366
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,040
Because it's the last event.

367
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,130
Let's make it a school festival
that will not leave any regrets.

368
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,090
Huh.

369
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,520
The last?

370
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,640
Futarou.

371
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,100
I'm glad that
you came specially to teach me.

372
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,350
But is it fine with your college entrance exam?

373
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,320
The preparation for school festival
also seems to be very busy...

374
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,400
Actually, today

375
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,820
I received the verdict
from my preferred school.

376
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,440
Eh?

377
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,570
Stop! Don't look!

378
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,570
Only this I don't want you to see!

379
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,200
Well, okay.

380
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,370
Seems going well.

381
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:27,830
(Grade: A) (Ranking 3rd out of 234516)

382
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,490
Grade

383
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,490

384

Value

390
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,350
(Grade: A) (Ranking 3rd out of 234516)
What! Boring.

391
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,870
I must say,

392
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,580
only you, Futarou
who is capable of study originally

393
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,290
could pull off something like that.

394
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,630
Please take care of everyone.

395
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,510
This is the crucial moment.

396
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,300
Don't worry.

397
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,260
Both their study and the school festival
will go well.

398
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,720
Wait and see, Ichika.

399
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,180
We will make it the best school festival.

400
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,770
Just give up, boys!

401
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,770
(Pancake, Takoyaki)
It's you girls who should give up!

402
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,810
Everyone likes fluffy pancakes so much!

403
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,360
Miku, say something too.

404
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,360
Well...

405
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,240
Look at last year's data!

406
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,070
There's no Japanese

407
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,320
who dislikes Takoyaki!

408
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,490
Right, Nino?

409
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,370
Well...

410
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,830
Didn't Nino said she likes pancake?

411
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,620
Why do you take her as on your side?

412
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,460
You were kidding, right, Nino?

413
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,460
Enough!

414
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,840
It can't be helped!

415
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
I am responsible for something

416
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,590
I proposed at the beginning.

417
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,930
Besides, eating and cooking are different.

418
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,010
That fluffy pancake,

419
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,520
even I could fail with it sometimes.

420
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,850
No further discussion is needed.

421
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,850
We have no choice but to do both!

422
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,480
I didn't expect the class would be
divided into halves because of that.

423
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,940
Yes. Why did you come out with pancake?

424
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,280
I heard that Futarou's mother

425
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,620
made pancakes often.

426
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,200
So,

427
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,490
then I recalled our mom.

428
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,210
Well, that's right.

429
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,760
That must be fluffy.

430
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,260
But it can't be made in a short time.

431
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,970
Have you ever made it?

432
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,100
That's the first dish
I challenged to make.

433
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,980
Takoyaki is much easier.

434
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,810
Especially so if it's a stall.

435
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,690
But you still didn't have to
say it so straightly...

436
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,110
I hate it. Something like
sneaking behind one's back.

437
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,700
Ah!

438
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,830
Nino, Miku.

439
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,210
You are together?

440
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,130
Futarou, what's the matter?

441
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,170
No, it's fine if so.

442
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,970
Well, you might be busy
for a lot of things.

443
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,680
But it's a long-awaited school festival.

444
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,140
So please enjoy yourselves.

445
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,850
What is he talking about?

446
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,220
I need to talk with Futarou.

447
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,350
- You go back first.
- Miku.

448
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,980
Futarou.

449
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,980
What's up, Miku?

450
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,520
Before the school festival,

451
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,190
there's something I need to tell you.

452
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,320
I see.

453
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,650
I also have something to tell you.

454
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,320
You can go first.

455
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,700
Okay. I heard it. Miku...

456
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,450
Your grade of the college entrance exam

457
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,210
seems to be A.

458
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,540
You did a really nice job!

459
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,670
Thinking about it,
it's been really a long way.

460
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,210
But all will be rewarded

461
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,260
once you enroll in college.

462
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,880
And it'll be worth it
for all the tutoring I've done.

463
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,260
That's right...

464
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,310
Well, Futarou.

465
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,020
Date with me.

466
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,190
Ah, sorry!

467
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,560
I didn't mean something strange.

468
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,770
Next Sunday,

469
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,530
can you go out with me?

470
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,860
Huh?

471
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,030
Eh?

472
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,120
Nino, you're also going home now?

473
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,870
Yes.

474
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,410
I am looking for someone
coming home with me.

475
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,700
Really?

476
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,450
But sorry.

477
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,460
I am going to the cram school directly.

478
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,750
Ah, I see.

479
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,710
You take it so seriously.

480
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,590
Ah, that...

481
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,960
How about your grade
in the college entrance exam, Nino?

482
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,470
It's not as bad as I thought.

483
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,720
It's B.

484
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,310
What?

485
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,390
What should I do, Nino?

486
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,770
I had been working on it
with all my strength.

487
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,400
(Grade D)
But this result!

488
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,190
Grade

489
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,190
NAKANO ITSUKI

490
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,190
NAME

491
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,190
UNIVERSITY OF
EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY

492
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,110
(Grade D)
There's no hope for my future!

493
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,570
After all I'm just a parody of my mom!

494
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,490
Becoming a teacher
is further than a dream!

495
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,740
Calm down!

496
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,160
Excuse me for being distraught.

497
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,540
The teacher said

498
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,370
it's better to have a talk with parents.

499
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,580
But something like that...

500
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,300
Our parents aren't there for us to talk to.

501
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,340
No, I didn't mean that.

502
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,390
I don't want to worry dad anymore.

503
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,680
Huh? Worry?

504
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,140
When did that man...

505
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,140
It's all thanks to dad

506
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,770
that we can grow up until now.

507
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,690
I gradually started to think that way.

508
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,860
Those flowers must be from dad.

509
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,070
Although he hasn't had much things done directly,

510
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,280
I think he's always been concerned about us.

511
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,370
That's not...

512
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,660
For now, I'll have a talk with Shimoda.

513
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,370
I will try to have a talk with the teacher
who takes care of me in the cram school.

514
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:22,960
(Akaya Academy)

515
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,080
(Akaya Academy)
And recently,

516
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,040
there'll be a special lecture

517
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,540
held by a famous teacher.

518
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,610
(Overwhelming teaching ability!
Thorough leadership!)

519
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,670
BY Mr. HINOSUKE MUDOU

520
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,670
Special Lecture

521
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,550
(Mr. Mudo Jinnosuke)
(Special Lecture)

522
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,010
Nino!

523
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,260
I have prepared
the invitation mentioned before.

524
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,890
I don't need it anymore.

525
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,430
- Eh, is it okay?
- Something like inviting dad

526
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,390
just came up in a thoughtless moment.

527
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,810
I think it's a good idea...

528
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,610
Anyway, I guess he won't come...

529
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,280
Even at home we can barely see him.

530
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,530
He's always doing something
behind our back.

531
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,320
So harsh...

532
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,910
But... Oh!

533
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,410
The girls who stared at me.

534
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,790
Before it gets troublesome,

535
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,080
I will just avoid it.

536
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,500
I have known about your ideas.

537
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,210
Eh?

538
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,830
In conclusion,

539
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,920
It's weird that Nino stays among boys.

540
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,800
You tried to claim that she must be

541
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,010
aiming at one boy
by cast amorous glances.

542
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,220
That's right!

543
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,180
If her target is Yusuke...

544
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,430
With Nino being our opponent,

545
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,770
We have no chance to win.

546
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,770
Sakura.

547
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,020
Cheer up!

548
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,190
That's wrong.

549
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,860
Eh?

550
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,070
The one Nino likes
is not someone in favor of Takoyaki.

551
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,570
At least I can confirm that.

552
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,110
So don't worry.

553
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,570
I don't believe it!

554
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,030
Why do you know that, Uesugi?

555
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,790
Because the class president
is in a neutral position

556
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,700
and couldn't vote for either side.

557
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Huh? I don't understand!

558
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,870
It doesn't matter!

559
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,580
Yes! That's right!

560
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,210
Because Nino...

561
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,130
Likes me!

562
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,180
So

563
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,800
just make up.

564
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,720
U...Uesugi.

565
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,770
Could you stop daydreaming?

566
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,810
Nino is pitiful this way.

567
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,860
No! She really...

568
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,240
I don't think it's bad
to do something behind one's back.

569
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,950
He must got his reasons.

570
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,890
Yotsuba.

571
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,100
About the invitation,

572
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,640
let's think about the contents together.

573
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,480
I don't remember allowing you to enter.

574
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,860
Get out now, Uesugi.

575
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,900
Hey, that's too aloof of you.

576
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,990
I came to inform you of some good news.

577
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,530
He's coming.

578
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,280
After more than ten years.

579
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,850
(Overwhelming teaching ability!
Thorough leadership!)

580
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,700
(Mr. Mudo Jinnosuke)
(Special Lecture)

581
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,750
This is Anne.

582
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,290
The one behind is

583
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,630
Sun!

584
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,340
Well, a question for everyone.

585
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,880
What's the name of this cute babe?

586
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,800
Don't they all look the same?

587
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,800
I can't tell the differences.

588
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,760
I want to have a guess.

589
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,720
Correct!

590
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,770
It's natural that they're similar.

591
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,810
These five penguins are sisters.

592
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,360
Just like you five.

593
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,900
Now that you say that,

594
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,940
that one is similar to Nino.

595
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,990
Then is that one Miku?

596
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,410
Futarou...

597
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,460
Futarou.

598
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,380
I want to learn about cooking.

599
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,390
So I don't want to go to college.

600
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,640
Sorry, Futarou.

601
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,850
I see.

602
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,190
I will support it if you have decided.

603
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,030
You have a very complicated face.

604
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,700
That's right. Technical school...

605
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,910
There's also something like that.

606
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,780
I also think there's nothing wrong
to go to college.

607
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,410
I don't know what the correct answer is.

608
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,700
But...

609
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,960
I can't help but want
to move on to my dream.

610
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,920
That's what I wanted to tell you.

611
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,460
Because you are special to me, Futarou.

612
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,130
That means...

613
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,630
Of course, something strange.

614
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,180
Why did Miku say that at such a time?

615
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,230
It shouldn't be just about her future.

616
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,650
I have said it.

617
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,280
Then it's your turn next time, Futarou.

618
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,320
The thing I must say out is...

619
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,620
Welcome home, brother.

620
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,160
Why are you in my home?

621
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,880
Here you are.

622
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,290
Yotsuba said she didn't remember

623
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,250
she has given it to you.

624
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,720
Ah...Thanks...

625
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,880
Alright!

626
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,720
The curry is ready.

627
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,260
May I have some?

628
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,470
Is it okay for you to do so?

629
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,060
I have heard about your grade.

630
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,150
Even though, I won't give up on
my desired school.

631
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,900
I will do my best with the determination
of skipping school festival.

632
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,030
Please see to it.

633
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,740
I'll feel upset if you get rejected.

634
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,610
If you fail like this, all I have done
would be meaningless.

635
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,200
That's wrong.

636
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,160
Ichika who dreams to become an actress.

637
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,660
Miku who aims at a chef.

638
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,120
Is your time spent with them also meaningless?

639
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,460
I don't want to think so.

640
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,420
Our relationships can no longer
be described as

641
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,630
just a tutor and students.

642
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,090
Uesugi.

643
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,760
Even if in the future,

644
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,060
failures would be waiting.

645
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,770
If we hadn't come to this school...

646
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,940
Would we regret

647
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,150
not having met you?

648
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,750
The relationship...

649
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,870
Was not meaningless.

650
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,370
The next,

651
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,420
it's my turn.

652
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,560

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,800
- I have become your fan!
- Please have my corn dog if you like.

1119
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,760
Thanks.

1120
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,720
I was willing to see how the stall was doing.

1121
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,190
Maybe Ichika is always in this feeling...

1122
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,400
Nino!

1123
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,230
What... It's Itsuki.

1124
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,150
That was really a charming dance!

1125
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,650
I even didn't feel like
it's just during a school festival.

1126
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,700
What are you doing
as it's now the school festival?

1127
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,910
I will end it before 15:00 o'clock.

1128
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,990
Don't worry.

1129
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,370
I'm tired.

1130
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,080
Where is Fu?

1131
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,630
This way please.

1132
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,260
Thanks for the guidance.

1133
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,760
You are a great young man.

1134
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,840
Uesugi!

1135
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,600
Eh?

1136
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,890
I want to make it a resting place here,

1137
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,100
but what should I do?

1138
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,640
Ah...

1139
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,270
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1140
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,780
Miku, good job.

1141
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,650
So slow, you are late.

1142
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,490
Anyway,

1143
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,490
everyone is here now.

1144
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,410
No, one else left.

1145
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,830
- Yo!
- Ichika!

1146
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,250
You came!

1147
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,120
Why didn't you contact us?

1148
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,330
I'm glad no chaos have been caused.

1149
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,500
I managed it.

1150
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,050
Now we can say everyone is here.

1151
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,840
After all, this makes my calm down.

1152
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,180
That's right.

1153
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,010
It's a rare chance, so just enjoy!

1154
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,390
We bought a lot at the stalls!

1155
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,850
I have been enduring!

1156
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,060
It looks so delicious!

1157
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,860
I like all of you five.

1158
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,360
It's such a sudden.

1159
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,490
W...What do you mean?

1160
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,700
I hope all we six can

1161
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,740
keep the current relations forever.

1162
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,160
But...

1163
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,330
I think I have to give an answer.

1164
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,880
Futarou.

1165
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,420
It's fine.

1166
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,750
Really?

1167
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,260
Anyways, it's not like I'm so unsophisticated
that I must bring this up

1168
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,840
during the school festival.

1169
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,050
It's just that...

1170
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,060
I also have something
I haven't sorted out.

1171
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,270
Give me more time until the last day.

1172
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,520
Come on, what's that?

1173
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,270
That sounds so discouraging.

1174
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,520
Then let's pull together again

1175
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,650
and have a toast!

1176
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,530
I want orange juice!

1177
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,440
May I have a matcha soda?

1178
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,400
We don't have that.

1179
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,990
Finally...

1180
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,280
You said it out.

1181
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,820
Until you figure out this difficult question,

1182
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,990
it will take a lot of time.

1183
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,080
Don't tease me, please.

1184
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,290
But, I am so jealous.

1185
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,590
This is yours, Futarou.

1186
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,460
Oh.

1187
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,840
So,

1188
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,260
celebrating the successful end of
the first day of school festival...

1189
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,180
Cheers!

1190
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,100
Everyone,

1191
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,850
the second day of Sunrise Festival!

1192
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,810
(Sunrise Festival)
Let's have an unscheduled interview with

1193
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,020
(Sunrise Festival)
the customers here today.

1194
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,420
(Sunrise Festival)
Is Nakano watching?

1195
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,400
Do you remember me?

1196
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,730
I come to see you.

1197
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,570
Are you still running?

1198
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,700
Please give back the micro!

1199
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,820
Sorry for the impoliteness.

1200
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,820
What...

1201
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,870
Well, let's start over.

1202
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,660
Hi, miss!

1203
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,700
What are you here for?

1204
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,080
Me?

1205
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,000
I come to meet a childhood friend.

1206
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,210
Uesugi, you don't have job today.

1207
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:11,880
(Sunrise Festival)
Eh?

1208
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,210
(Sunrise Festival)

1209
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,380
(Sunrise Festival)
It's a rare chance.

1210
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,800
(Corn)
Just enjoy the school festival.

1211
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,930
(Corn)

1212
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,300
I don't have the money to

1213
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,390
have fun or eat...

1214
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,940
Right, maybe I can go there...

1215
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,980
Ah, I found you.

1216
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,270
Futarou!

1217
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,900
You have grown up!

1218
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,820
Takebayashi!

1219
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,490
(Target Shooting, Bite-sized Sponge Cakes,
Grilled Rice Balls)

1220
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,280
(Target Shooting)
Futarou you are so clumsy.

1221
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,160
You should make it a little more left.

1222
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,450
You are so annoying by my side.

1223
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,450
I want that one!

1224
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,870
Aim that next time!

1225
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,630
He said that to us yesterday,

1226
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,590
but is dating another girl today?

1227
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,760
Uesugi is not to be sneezed at.

1228
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,390
Futarou, come here.

1229
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,310
Hey!

1230
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,600
Ah!

1231
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,980
(Fluffy Pancake)

1232
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,560
(Fluffy Pancake)
Would you like a piece of pancake?

1233
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,810
Would you like a piece of pancake?

1234
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:09,810
Futarou.

1235
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,110
There's pancake!

1236
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,070
I want to eat!

1237
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,070
Ah...

1238
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,400
This is the stall of my class.

1239
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,360
Fu...

1240
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,740
Thanks for taking care of my Futarou.

1241
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,160
My?

1242
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,830
Who are you?

1243
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,160
Nice to meet you.

1244
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,870
I'm Takebayashi.

1245
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,710
We have been in the same grade
from primary school.

1246
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,880
Oh, is that so?

1247
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,090
We are also in the same grade.
And also tutor and students.

1248
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,760
So it can be said we are much closer

1249
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,090
than just classmates.

1250
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,340
Really! It's an coincidence!

1251
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,050
I have also taught Futarou once!

1252
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,220
I was surprised
when I was asked for tutoring by him

1253
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,480
a problem child who listened to none.

1254
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,690
No, they are my students.

1255
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,440
Ah, really?

1256
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,570
It's clear then.

1257
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,940
You and I,

1258
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,280
whose relationship to him is closer?

1259
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,610
Yotsuba,

1260
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,360
I'm already...

1261
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,240
Uesugi and I...

1262
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,790
Thanks.

1263
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,620
If that's true,

1264
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,710
it can be said that we had been

1265
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,210
indirectly taken care by you.

1266
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,380
It seems the time we spent with Uesugi

1267
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,380
has lost to you.

1268
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,340
But,

1269
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,880
we won't lose in terms of the depth.

1270
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,930
You girls...

1271
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,760
It's so shameful, so please stop.

1272
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,310
Eh!

1273
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,560
Besides, Takebayashi...

1274
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,230
Stop teasing please.

1275
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,770
They are my rare friends.

1276
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,690
They are all special.

1277
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,730
Ah!

1278
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,860
You really have grown up.

1279
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:41,860
I apologize to both of you.

1280
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,870
May I have one pancake?

1281
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,370
Yes!

1282
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,740
Yotsuba...

1283
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,990
Sorry.

1284
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,700
I have to go back to work.

1285
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,630
Fu!

1286
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,340
My feeling has never changed!

1287
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,510
Welcome back. What happened?

1288
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,310
Futarou looks good.

1289
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,310
All the quintuplets are nice girls.

1290
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,980
Eh? Quintuplets?

1291
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,560
Just do your best,

1292
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,650
Futarou.

1293
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,040
Is this choice...

1294
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,250
Or,

1295
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,460
is choosing itself right?

1296
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,880
To figure that question out,

1297
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,540
three days

1298
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,590
are too short.

1299
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,600
(When the last festival comes to Ichika)

1300
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,710

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
(When the last festival comes to Ichika)
Until now,

1302
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:52,900
(When the last festival comes to Ichika)
School Festival of Asahi Senior School,

1303
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,390
School Festival of Asahi Senior School,

1304
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,480
closing party,

1305
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,940
and all schedules are over.

1306
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,610
(The First Day of the School Festival)

1307
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,640
First day of the school Festival

1308
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,030
The taxi is so slow...

1309
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,240
- Well...
- It reminds me

1310
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,280
Nakano Ichika

1311
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,330
seems to be in the school.

1312
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,080
Nakano Ichika!

1313
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,960
She is so cute in the previous movies.

1314
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,080
Ah!

1315
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,380
I also want to kiss Ichika like a drama!

1316
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,260
Maybe, are you shocked that I kissed?

1317
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,220
No.

1318
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,470
I am an actress.

1319
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,760
I need to do so sometime.

1320
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,300
I don't mean that.

1321
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,260
That's right.

1322
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,810
Futarou has experienced that, right?

1323
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,270
Why did you...

1324
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,140
And that's just an accident.

1325
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,560
You really have kissed!

1326
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,860
So, with who?

1327
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,940
I... I don't know.

1328
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,490
You all dressed like Itsuki at that time.

1329
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,200
So, who do you think it was?

1330
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,700
The taxi comes!

1331
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,120
You had a narrow escape.

1332
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,590
Well...

1333
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,630
Maybe I won't be able to come to
the school festival for the next few days.

1334
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,970
So can't you answer me now?

1335
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,300
Well if you are still wondering...

1336
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,050
Got it.

1337
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,270
I can't choose anyone.

1338
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,140
That's my answer.

1339
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,150
The worst!

1340
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,950
You are always saying honeyed words!

1341
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:27,450
(The Second Day of the School Festival)

1342
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,430
Second day of the school festival

1343
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,360
(The Second Day of the School Festival)
It hurts!

1344
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:28,570
(The Second Day of the School Festival)

1345
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,360
(The Second Day of the School Festival)
Okay! Good.

1346
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,870
Okay! Good.

1347
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,280
That settles!

1348
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,240
A...Are you okay?

1349
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:37,040
Ichika, you seems familiar with
hitting people.

1350
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,840
Ah!

1351
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,460
I worked hard today too!

1352
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,630
Go back to hotel and have a nice sleep.

1353
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,730
Ichika, something terrible!

1354
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,930
Boss?

1355
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,470
There was a call that...

1356
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,140
Your sister seemed to have fallen down.

1357
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,400
I am relieved as it seems you're fine.

1358
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,730
Take a nice rest.

1359
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,650
Eh?

1360
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,030
Nino, Futarou...

1361
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,110
Ichika, you also came.

1362
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,320
I got a call.

1363
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,910
So I can't contain myself.

1364
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,410
What about the others?

1365
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,080
They have calmed down temporarily.

1366
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,870
We are all fine,

1367
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,290
so don't worry about us.

1368
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,590
I see... That's great.

1369
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,710
The clean-up has not finished,
so I'm back to school.

1370
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,340
Fu, please send Ichika back.

1371
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,970
Well...

1372
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,930
So, I'll go home today.

1373
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,770
Have you done your work today, Futarou?

1374
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,980
Well...

1375
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,690
Then, let's have a walk.

1376
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,650
Wow!

1377
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,570
It's unexpectedly wide here.

1378
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,280
Futarou, do you remember?

1379
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,410
Isn't here the venue of
the fireworks display?

1380
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,450
With no stalls or humans,

1381
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,330
it's wide indeed.

1382
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,460
I didn't mean without any people.

1383
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,500
Do you know?

1384
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,840
There are a lot of couples formed
in these three days.

1385
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,760
Among the tree days,
what makes the most couples is

1386
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,340
the closing party at the third day.

1387
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,300
I wondered if you knew it

1388
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,140
and said that.

1389
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,100
Do you think I'm someone who

1390
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,770
swims with the tide?

1391
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,190
You're talking like that again.

1392
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,230
You look tough but sometimes
you're unexpectedly vulgar.

1393
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,320
Huh? When?

1394
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,230
When you saw a luxury car,
you peeked into it.

1395
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,200
When you went on a long-awaited trip,
you were so excited.

1396
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,410
When you were at the top of the hill,
you yelled yoo-hoo.

1397
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:35,910
You have a good memory.

1398
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,370
Well,

1399
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,740
those are also moments
when you are so cute.

1400
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,410
Please cherish such sincere feelings.

1401
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,130
So,

1402
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,750
don't say you can't choose anyone.

1403
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,800
I myself can't understand my feelings.

1404
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,510
You have taken it too difficult
and overthought too much.

1405
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,720
Or just try not to think.

1406
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,760
We talked about kiss yesterday, right?

1407
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,430
Nino, Miku, Yotsuba and Itsuki.

1408
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
I have a question.

1409
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,020
Who will make you be pleased with?

1410
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,280
What?

1411
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,860
Ah, a vending machine!

1412
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,150
I'll give you money,
so buy whatever you like.

1413
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,900
Huh?

1414
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,820
Whatever you want to drink.

1415
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,790
I will wait for you at the bench there.

1416
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,450
Why suddenly...

1417
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,170
Futarou!

1418
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,710
Nino is black tea.

1419
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,830
Miku is green tea.

1420
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,210
Yotsuba is juice.

1421
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,920
Itsuki is coffee!

1422
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,710
So cunning...

1423
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,260
I have to do this.

1424
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,550
So what will you do, Futarou?

1425
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:44,930
(Ten Minutes Later)

1426
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:44,930
Ten Minutes Later

1427
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,150
Mon...

1428
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,150
I kept her waiting too long.

1429
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,400
I have showed something wack of myself.

1430
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,110
I always feel like that when with you.

1431
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,070
The first son to the first daughter...

1432
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,330
We have both been so hard.

1433
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,460
Eh?

1434
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,620
You looked at them, right?

1435
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,040
My lips.

1436
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,000
Why?

1437
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,590
Were you awake?

1438
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,170
Why did you look at them?

1439
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,780
Who is the one I kissed

1440
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,720
among you five,

1441
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,430
I was thinking it might be you.

1442
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,350
I'm so disgusting.

1443
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
Disgusting.

1444
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,690
Ah!

1445
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,990
How about it? Was it me?

1446
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,370
I...Ichika.

1447
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,160
So rather than just seeing, isn't it easier

1448
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,540
to tell the difference by doing it actually?

1449
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,710
I... I know, but...

1450
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,500
Do it merely for that?

1451
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,000
You may have used to it in acting.

1452
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,590
Oh...

1453
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,260
The drama mentioned yesterday,

1454
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,590
the partner was also an actress.

1455
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:00,970
Eh?

1456
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,140
Something like missing a male...

1457
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,350
I'm still NG with it.

1458
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,770
So, you are the first...

1459
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,890
It's not something

1460
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,770
you can easily do with a girl
in same grade.

1461
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,060
So remember it.

1462
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,570
Ah, I forgot to ask.

1463
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,690
Did you feel happy?

1464
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,740
What's that?
Why you talked so condescendingly?

1465
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,370
Cherish your sincere feelings.

1466
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,290
Come on, you are shy?

1467
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,330
Well.

1468
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,500
That's right.

1469
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,670
No matter who will Futarou choose.

1470
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,630
This feeling,

1471
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,130
doesn't seem to last for much longer.

1472
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,220
(When the last festival comes to Nino)

1473
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:53,500
The Last Festival - Nino's Side

So, celebrating the successful end of

1481
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,640
First day of the School festival

1482
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,110
So, celebrating the successful end of

1483
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,990
the first day of school festival...

1484
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,030
Cheers!

1485
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,820
Great!

1486
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,830
Hey you!

1487
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:07,790
Delicious!

1488
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,410
How? How about it?

1489
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,830
You...

1490
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,460
How long will you
keep this showy costume?

1491
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,550
But, I wanted to show you.

1492
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,420
Nino, you was so cute!

1493
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,590
Uh-huh...

1494
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,550
It was me
who should have taken part in that

1495
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,800
opening ceremony.

1496
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Nino helped me to participate!

1497
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,350
You have had a nice face to anyone

1498
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,100
and accept too much work!

1499
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,730
Don't you also help in the theater club?

1500
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,270
Stop before the limit comes!

1501
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,650
Nino, you still always
take care of your sisters.

1502
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,780
Not only because of that.

1503
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,030
I took this work because...

1504
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,910
I thought I could have a good overall view

1505
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,030
of all the audience seats from the stage.

1506
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,240
What does it mean?

1507
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,330
We...

1508
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,710
Sent an invitation to dad.

1509
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,710
He didn't show up at all.

1510
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,130
Well, I didn't expect him
to come at the beginning.

1511
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,460
I don't mind.

1512
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,630
I see...

1513
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,380
Maybe he has come now.

1514
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,010
Let's have a look around the stalls.

1515
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,680
Gah! He's not here.

1516
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,140
Wasn't there any contact?

1517
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,640
Eh? No!

1518
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,350
Come on!

1519
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:18,060
With such a bold confession,

1520
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,150
why can we be alone?

1521
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,110
Just contact him directly.

1522
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,650
Stop!

1523
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,200
Enough.

1524
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,820
I haven't been expecting from the beginning.

1525
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,870
Didn't you gather your courage
and send the invitation?

1526
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,200
Can you accept it?

1527
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,330
I'll believe and wait.

1528
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,170
(The Second Day of the School Festival)

1529
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,280
Second day of the School Festival

1530
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,250
(Bubble Tea)

1531
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,920
Fluffy and sweet pancakes.

1532
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,510
Would you like some?

1533
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,550
Miss. Pancake seller.

1534
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,100
There are obviously more people
than yesterday.

1535
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,350
It seems it's been rumored to come here.

1536
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,880
Hi!

1537
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,190
Uesugi contacted us.

1538
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,690
Is this store Nino's class'?

1539
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,110
Good afternoon.

1540
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,360
Manager, thanks for coming.

1541
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,490
Eh, didn't you feel disappointed just now?

1542
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,280
(Fluffy Pancake)

1543
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,580
(Fluffy Pancake)
I thought it was dad for a second.

1544
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,830
Everyone, good job!

1545
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,960
The second day of School Festival of
Asahi Senior School is over now.

1546
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,170
Hey, hey.

1547
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,720
We might win the best store!

1548
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,090
I can't wait longer.

1549
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:29,550
Eh?

1550
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:31,470
Nino, come with me.

1551
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,930
Uesugi?

1552
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,430
It's fine.

1553
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,930
I won't come.

1554
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,770
I sent an invitation, but dad didn't come.

1555
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,860
We are no more than dusts for him.

1556
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,320
Although the school festival
will go on tomorrow,

1557
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,360
it's already enough.

1558
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,200
It won't come true anyway,

1559
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,360
I just regret that I tried to invite him.

1560
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,780
I don't know well about your family.

1561
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,160
I only know it's different from

1562
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,580
the usual parent-child relationship.

1563
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,000
But on the contrary, do you know this?

1564
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,250
He shows extreme cautiousness to me.

1565
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:02,840
Huh?

1566
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,520
Should I call
that the eye expression of a father?

1567
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,780
But I know, if he didn't love you, he could
never have made that eye expression to me.

1568
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,470
That's why he was complaining.

1569
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,140
He said you were so troublesome.

1570
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,390
Hey, Uesugi!

1571
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,470
We found the people you showed us!

1572
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,100
We saw the video again.

1573
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,100
And wondered if there's someone with
the same characters you've been looking for.

1574
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,690
Where do you come from today?

1575
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,860
Oh, a call from my company?

1576
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,030
Sorry for the impoliteness.

1577
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,320
What!

1578
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,490
How? It's just like this...

1579
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,450
Thank you.

1580
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,370
It seems he has come.

1581
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,200
What to do, Nino?

1582
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,500
Fu,

1583
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,750
take me to dad's.

1584
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,000
That's right.

1585
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Why did I become discouraged?

1586
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,920
Regardless of pushing,
pulling or no response...

1587
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,090
Now I shall go confront him.

1588
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,600
(General Hospital)

1589
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:00,730
(Admission Pass)
Hi.

1590
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:01,020
(Admission Pass)

1591
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,440
(Admission Pass)
I came to give back your daughter I have borrowed.

1592
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,270
Today why did you...

1593
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,270
Go home before it gets dark.

1594
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,820
Wait. It will be ready in a while.

1595
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,870
Have a try please.

1596
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,790
We have known you came to school today.

1597
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,580
Pancake?

1598
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,920
It's surprisingly cheap to make.

1599
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,420
And my daughters were so happy
to have some.

1600
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,880
I wanted to make it for them
for the last time...

1601
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,550
The last time...

1602
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,090
There's nothing like that.

1603
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:34,890
Nakano.

1604
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,510
I can't express my gratitude more.

1605
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,100
But

1606
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,930
don't spend your precious time

1607
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,600
on me with little remaining days anymore.

1608
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,520
Remaining days...

1609
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,060
Please don't say such a thing.

1610
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,030
Doctor Reina is my teacher.

1611
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,860
Teacher.

1612
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:54,200
That's something years ago.

1613
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,740
Besides, if you die,

1614
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,870
your daughters will be so sad.

1615
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,160
That's right.

1616
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,870
I only feel regretful about them.

1617
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,590
Making sure their grown-up safe and happy

1618
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,840
is my responsibility.

1619
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,550
Thank you, Nakano.

1620
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,840
Please let me be spoiled by
your grace a little longer.

1621
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,510
When I'm discharged,

1622
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,510
please let me treat you a meal.

1623
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,600
Pancake.

1624
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:23,600
I think you will like it too.

1625
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,360
The dough was made by Miku.

1626
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,070
She who is bad at cooking,

1627
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:33,070
has found her goal
and been doing her best.

1628
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,700
Not only Miku.

1629
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,780
All five of us,

1630
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,120
have grown much more mature than the past.

1631
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,080
We want you to see that growth by our sides.

1632
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,160
Dad.

1633
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:57,720
You ate it!

1634
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,140
Eh... But...

1635
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,020
Why are you putting on that face?

1636
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,560
This taste...

1637
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,440
You have faced it without running away.

1638
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,730
Eh? What do you mean?

1639
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,610
Besides, there're too many.

1640
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:15,440
I can't finish them all by myself.

1641
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,160
Let's eat it with the whole family next time.

1642
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:23,290
What are you saying suddenly!

1643
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,660
But, everyone...

1644
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,370
Will be very happy.

1645
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,170
Great, Nino.

1646
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,040
Then, can I use the toilet.

1647
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,250
Uesugi,

1648
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,590
wait.

1649
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,090
Is this your plan?

1650
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,090
No?

1651
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,880
Yes. He just took me here.

1652
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,850
So what?

1653
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,810
That's still not something a tutor should do.

1654
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,730
But that's something I can't do.

1655
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,810
I think it's good to have asked you
to take care of them sincerely from my heart.

1656
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:51,270
Oops!

1657
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:53,730
As an abortive parent,

1658
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,030
I hope you can think about

1659
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:59,360
your relationship with my daughters carefully.

1660
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,700
Fu, thank you for today.

1661
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,830
And for all until now...

1662
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,210
And... besides that...

1663
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,080
About tomorrow...

1664
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,710
Hey! Danger!

1665
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,220
That was close!

1666
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:19,930
Huh?

1667
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:22,890
What are you doing?

1668
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:25,680
I just slipped.

1669
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:26,890
We are going back.

1670
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,480
Tsk, so pitiful.

1671
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,190
Well. It's fine like so.

1672
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:34,270
Barely safe.

1673
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,070
Are you okay?

1674
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,580
After all I must attack ahead for love.

1675
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,040
Eh?

1676
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,160
What again?

1677
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:48,790
Ugh!

1678
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:50,870
Hey, dad.

1679
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,830
I just want to tell you this.

1680
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,290
No matter how the relationship between

1681
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:57,710
our sisters will change in the future,

1682
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,920
my feeling will never change.

1683
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,760
Asking Fu to be our tutor,

1684
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,890
thank you.

1685
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:14,070
The Last Festival - Miku's side

1686
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:12,730
(When the last festival comes to Miku)

1687
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:13,730
(When the last festival comes to Miku)
Until now,

1688
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:14,080
(When the last festival comes to Miku)
School Festival of Asahi Senior School,

1689
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,560
School Festival of Asahi Senior School,

1690
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,650
closing party,

1691
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:19,150
and all schedules are over.

1692
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:21,900
(The First Day of the School Festival)

1693
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:24,030
Primer día del festival.

1694
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,660
(The First Day of the School Festival)
Eh, isn't he from our class?

1695
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,660
He's checking our selling situation.

1696
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,540
Just because we compromised.

1697
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,000
We can't lose to the boys' Takoyaki!

1698
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,500
Let's work harder, Miku!

1699
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,080
W...Well.

1700
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,130
About the boys in our class...

1701
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,050
Let's stop being stubborn
and make up with them!

1702
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,630
It must be fun to work together!

1703
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,390
If only I have the courage to say so...

1704
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,390
Huh?

1705
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:48,180
He's not here.

1706
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,470
I will try to look there.

1707
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,190
Hey, Uesugi!

1708
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,770
Huh?

1709
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,360
Tell the boys!

1710
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,940
Stop reconnoitering sneakily.

1711
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,030
Or rather, you guys could make up.

1712
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:03,490
Well,

1713
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,820
Maybe I can...

1714
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,410
go check their selling too?

1715
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:11,040
Tomorrow is crucial!

1716
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,040
We can't lose to the girls!

1717
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,620
Yay!

1718
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:16,830
What should I do, Futarou?

1719
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,880
If there's someone
who can make a change,

1720
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,800
MIku, only you.

1721
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:23,840
As you are in the opposing side,

1722
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,550
maybe you can change their minds.

1723
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:29,310
Well, it's only my intuition.

1724
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,100
You're free to

1725
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,180
decide whether to believe.

1726
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:37,350
Uh-huh, I believe Futarou.

1727
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,980
Good afternoon.

1728
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:42,740
Nakano...

1729
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,610
Nakano!?

1730
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,030
Why are you here,
the leader of pancake?

1731
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,870
W...Well...

1732
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:49,490
Takoyaki,

1733
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,240
please give me one!

1734
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:51,870
Huh?

1735
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,040
It looks delicious.

1736
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,830
I'll enjoy having it.

1737
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,580
Be careful as it's hot.

1738
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,090
Thank you.

1739
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,930
Delicious!

1740
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:15,850
I want the girls of our class
to have a try too.

1741
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,520
Huh?

1742
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:18,730
After the end of the first day,

1743
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,690
I will take everyone here.

1744
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,690
You boys' seriousness

1745
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,900
should be transmitted to everyone!

1746
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,360
It's all of a sudden for you to say that...

1747
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,620
They said something like Takoyaki sucked!

1748
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,410
We won't make Takoyaki for them.

1749
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:33,950
Hey, you should accept...

1750
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,700
Wait, Futarou.

1751
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,160
I believe it...

1752
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:39,710
If I don't say it...

1753
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:42,920
I'm sorry they said so that day.

1754
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,920
But,

1755
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,090
I believe you also don't want
the festival to end in this way.

1756
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,010
Let's make it a great school festival that

1757
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,930
could delight everyone,

1758
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,930
even after all is over and we get graduated.

1759
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:55,930
Speaking of that,

1760
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:58,640
Maeda, you give some to Matsui to eat, right?

1761
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,230
Boo! I told you to not say out.

1762
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,150
What did you do, Maeda...

1763
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,110
Only you stole the march,

1764
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:06,650
I also wanted Maruyama to have a try!

1765
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:08,240
Then I want Yuri to try!

1766
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,240
Come on.

1767
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:12,910
Well, it's not that I don't have someone
who I want to her to eat.

1768
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,040
Nakano...

1769
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,330
For these guys too,
could I ask you to bring the girls?

1770
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,040
Uh-huh, of course.

1771
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:23,090
Thank you. It's all because of Futarou.

1772
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,840
Huh? I didn't do anything.

1773
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,920
It's you who moved everyone.

1774
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,050
You become stronger, Miku.

1775
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:44,310
Class 1 Grade 3,

1776
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,440
the stall of Takoyaki

1777
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,190
is decided to be closed.

1778
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,780
(The Second Day of the School Festival)

1779
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:55,520
The Sunrise festival

1780
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:53,140
Second day of the School Festival

1781
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,910
Miku, I've found Uesugi.

1782
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,410
He's really outside.

1783
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,160
He's talking with an unknown girl!

1784
00:52:59,160 --> 00:52:59,750
Eh!

1785
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:03,670
Do you know her?

1786
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,250
No.

1787
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,300
Could it be...

1788
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,710
Uesugi said so yesterday.

1789
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,220
He said...

1790
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,630
He likes all five of us.

1791
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,850
Let's trust Uesugi!

1792
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,350
Trust.

1793
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,350
When we just met,

1794
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:20,730
he told me...

1795
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,690
To trust the thing I like.

1796
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,940
No matter what happens,

1797
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,070
I like Futarou.

1798
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,280
Because I like Futarou.

1799
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,530
I will trust him and go ahead.

1800
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,660
(The Third Day of the School Festival)

1801
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,670
Third day of the school festival

1802
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:37,660
Miku?

1803
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,250
I haven't seen you for the whole day.

1804
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,040
Sorry about the class stall...

1805
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,040
Futarou.

1806
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:45,330
Come with me.

1807
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,670
Roof?

1808
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,210
Isn't it prohibited during the school festival?

1809
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:52,590
Uh-huh. I don't think
it'll cause any troubles here.

1810
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,260
Stop the nonsense!

1811
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,050
Anyway, you're laughing at the fact that

1812
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,680
we can't open the store anymore!

1813
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,140
I said no one said so!

1814
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,560
It's bad of you boys to cause the accident!

1815
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,440
What the heck!

1816
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,600
What?

1817
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:06,480
Was it you who called them here?

1818
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,610
It's true it won't make any trouble here.

1819
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:10,570
That's wrong.

1820
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,200
It's me who made the trouble.

1821
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:14,950
Nakano.

1822
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:17,200
Miku, what is the letter about?

1823
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,330
Make up.

1824
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,160
Eh?

1825
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:23,120
Please! Make! Up!

1826
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,040
All the boys and girls
are stubborn all the time.

1827
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,670
We are already senior school students!

1828
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:30,210
We will be in college next year.

1829
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:33,380
Don't you feel shamed to
quarrel like children like this?

1830
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:36,550
There shouldn't be any better or worse
between pancakes and Takoyaki.

1831
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,390
Of course the same for boys and girls.

1832
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:39,600
Both are delicious.

1833
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,270
All have worked hard!

1834
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:43,270
Why can't you admit that?

1835
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,730
School festival

1836
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,810
was not fun from the preparation.

1837
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,230
I felt uncomfortable.

1838
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,610
I have been enduring.

1839
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:51,780
It's the limit now!

1840
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,740
Miku...

1841
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:56,910
You...

1842
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,910
The girls have been working and are tired.

1843
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,120
I hope the boys could help with

1844
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,830
the operation of the pancake stall.

1845
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:04,750
Huh?

1846
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:06,120
No, but...

1847
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,580
Even if I'd agree,

1848
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,130
what would the others say?

1849
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,420
Leave it to me.

1850
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,210
I will persuade them.

1851
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,550
Trust me.

1852
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:18,970
Sorry.

1853
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:20,930
I thought it's impossible
for them to make up.

1854
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:23,600
So I drew the line
and gave up by myself causally.

1855
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,140
You really gave me a lesson.

1856
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:26,980
Eh?

1857
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:29,860
Miku?

1858
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,320
Who was that girl?

1859
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:33,860
Girl?

1860
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,490
The girl you did target shooting with.

1861
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,780
She's a childhood friend.

1862
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,910
Do you like her? As a female.

1863
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,080
J...Just a friend.

1864
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:44,490
Really? Then it's fine.

1865
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,870
I have been enduring to not ask about it.

1866
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,080
Enduring, why...

1867
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:51,920
Just ask me without consideration.

1868
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:52,670
Eh?

1869
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,090
Uh-huh. I knew.

1870
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:56,260
So,

1871
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:57,720
I want to kiss you.

1872
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,260
Eh?

1873
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,340
Although I said without consideration,

1874
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,930
why is what coming now?

1875
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,310
Sorry, I will listen to your answer later.

1876
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,810
No matter what insurmountable wall appears,

1877
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,400
as long as I trust myself,

1878
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,360
I can go ahead towards anywhere.

1879
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,160
No more hesitation.

1880
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:30,630
The Last Festival - Yotsuba's Side

1881
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,160

closing party,

1886
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,550
and all schedules are over.

1887
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:38,970
(The First Day of School Festival)

1888
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,010
First day of the School Festival

1889
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,010
First day of the School Festival

1890
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,470

This is the end, heroes.

1896
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,770
It's pitiful of you to die here.

1897
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:54,230
Become my subordinates!

1898
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,610
I wondered how about the show at 1.

1899
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:04,830
I'm glad that Senior Nanako
could take my part.

1900
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,240
I'm also glad that

1901
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,240
I can help.

1902
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,660
I come for the security check.

1903
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,830
Thanks for your hard work.

1904
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:15,130
Freshness of ingredients
seems to be no problem.

1905
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,000
Ah.

1906
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,420
The paper trash there
is very dangerous.

1907
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,720
Please put it away.

1908
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,470
If it goes on like this,
I can make it by 15:00 o'clock.

1909
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,010
How about the fried chicken?

1910
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,600
Thank you for coming to help.

1911
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,600
Please take these service tickets.

1912
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,560
(Fried Chicken Free Treat)
I have been longing to eat!

1913
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,950
This is... my limit...

1914
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,410
You worked really hard.

1915
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,660
Yotsuba...

1916
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:52,460
Uesugi, you're as weak as a bean sprout.
So please take a rest.

1917
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,750
I'm sorry.

1918
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,040
I'm fine now.

1919
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:58,050
Excuse me.

1920
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,840
I want to finish it before 15:00 o'clock.

1921
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,170
I'm worried about you.

1922
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:04,720
You can't move
before you listen to my words.

1923
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:11,100
It reminds I haven't eaten anything
from morning...

1924
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,350
There are so many stalls!

1925
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:15,350
That's why you have no power.

1926
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,520
This is for you.

1927
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,110
Please have a full meal.

1928
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:20,110
Eh?

1929
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:21,650
Is it okay?

1930
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,610
Yes! I'm full.

1931
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,780
I'm full and good!

1932
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,660
Let's carry it and go!

1933
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:32,000
Yotsuba,

1934
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:33,460
thank you.

1935
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:35,960
It's fine to have you with me.

1936
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,790
What are you saying?

1937
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:40,130
It's just helping each other.

1938
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,010
The same for me...

1939
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,550
Only by being approved by Uesugi,

1940
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,550
I feel that all is rewarded.

1941
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:51,060
Two days left
before Uesugi giving the answer.

1942
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:53,810
It'll be another day like today.

1943
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:54,730
I'm sure so.

1944
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,270
But,

1945
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:58,770
if he were to choose me...

1946
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:04,900
Damn!

1947
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,330
Second day of the School Festival

1948
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,280
(The Second Day of School Festival)
Why?

1949
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:08,200
Being decided to be closed...

1950
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,280
We worked hard just for this day.

1951
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,370
Considering such an accident happened,

1952
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:14,960
we can only accept it.

1953
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,620
We were told to be careful
as it was dangerous, didn't we?

1954
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,290
Damn!

1955
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:26,720
Please give me some work!

1956
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,130
Huh?

1957
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,890
Is there something troubling you?

1958
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:35,230
Ah, here are you.

1959
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,480
You are a friend of Futarou, right?

1960
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:44,820
Eh?

1961
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,990
School or at home?

1962
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,780
It's the hospital.

1963
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,660
I was shocked
when I heard you were here.

1964
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,370
You didn't give yourself any time to rest, right?

1965
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:56,830
I see.

1966
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:58,790
Sorry to worry you.

1967
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:00,250
I will go back now.

1968
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,750
There are still lots of things to do.

1969
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,250
Eh?

1970
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,800
If I don't hurry up,

1971
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,010
everyone in theater club will feel troubled.

1972
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:08,800
Yotsuba, it's already night.

1973
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:09,890
(General Hospital)

1974
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:11,930
(General Hospital)
The second day has been over.

1975
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:13,010
(General Hospital)

1976
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,020
Six years ago in Kyoto,

1977
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,850
was it you who met Futarou?

1978
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,520
Why...

1979
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,440
After that,

1980
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,190
he showed me the photo so much that
I started to hate it.

1981
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:30,700
I asked your sisters
at the pancake stall just now,

1982
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,830
and I knew you got separated alone that day.

1983
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,620
I can see why you could be his teacher now.

1984
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,290
I'm glad he could meet you.

1985
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,170
I will tell Futarou about this...

1986
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,500
Please don't say!

1987
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,040
Why?

1988
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,710
Because I don't want to disappoint him.

1989
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:50,630
Uesugi has been striving on a right path.

1990
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:53,010
But I was obsessed with useless things

1991
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,310
and spent the six years meaninglessly.

1992
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:57,810
I was useless to anyone,

1993
01:00:57,810 --> 01:00:59,810
and have only made troubles.

1994
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,900
What is the meaning of my existence?

1995
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,650
Only this?

1996
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,570
You think you are someone

1997
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,320
meaningless and unnecessary.

1998
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,570
I know someone who said the same words.

1999
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:15,490
And that person now

2000
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:17,490
is looking forward and starting to go ahead.

2001
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,870
May you also step out from the past.

2002
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:22,710
You got up?

2003
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:24,580
Uesugi...

2004
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,040
Let me through please.

2005
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,090
If I don't go.

2006
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,710
What will you do if you go?

2007
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,840
Everyone has already gone home.

2008
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,890
Then I will go apologize
to every one of them.

2009
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,560
Not only everyone in theater club.

2010
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,850
But also those who I took quests from afterwards.

2011
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:41,640
Those I made troubles to...

2012
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,150
I'm to blame.

2013
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,480
What should I say to them?

2014
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,190
But I can't let you go.

2015
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:51,320
It's said you need to
stay absolutely rested until tomorrow.

2016
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:53,320
I'm not going to leave here.

2017
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,950
Have a seat for now.

2018
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:57,990
I will tell you.

2019
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:01,290
About what happened during the school festival
when you were not there.

2020
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:03,160
This is the end,

2021
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,500
heroes!

2022
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,420
This girl!

2023
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,420
She's the leader of
the track-and-field sports club, isn't she?

2024
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:10,630
She wanted to meet you.

2025
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,220
Seems she was there
at yesterday's performance.

2026
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:16,680
But the size of the costume
was taken of me.

2027
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:18,850
Do you remember them two?

2028
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:21,680
They are from the clothing club.

2029
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:22,890
Could it be...

2030
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:24,810
Did they sew the costume?

2031
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:26,310
I'm to blame.

2032
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,110
Not only them two...

2033
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:29,480
(Reception This Way)

2034
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,980
(Fried Chicken)

2035
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:33,700
Did you notice?

2036
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,280
It's not blamed on you.

2037
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:39,780
All gathered for you.

2038
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,330
It's helping each other, right?

2039
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:47,170
Sometimes you can be the one to be helped.

2040
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:48,790
Please entrust us.

2041
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,300
I'm also the one who owned you a favor.

2042
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,590
Uesugi,

2043
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,680
for the inconvenience I caused this time,

2044
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,140
I apologize sincerely.

2045
01:02:58,550 --> 01:02:59,600
The last day...

2046
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,390
Please take

2047
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,140
my position at the festival.

2048
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:05,520
Ah, all on me.

2049
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:13,500
Third day of the School Festival

2050
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:13,400
(The Third Day of the School Festival)

2051
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,820
Uesugi Futarou.

2052
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,950
Long time no see, Reina...

2053
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,870
I had so many things to do today
and I'm tired now.

2054
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,670
Please come to me later.

2055
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:33,090
Thanks for remembering
and keeping the promise.

2056
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:35,420
I didn't keep it.

2057
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:37,090
Sorry.

2058
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,350
Never mind.

2059
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,510
Doesn't Futarou care?

2060
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:43,970
Well...

2061
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:46,430
What is much more important than
something in the past

2062
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:47,600
is the present.

2063
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:48,600
Ah.

2064
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,780
I won't rely on the memories with you anymore.

2065
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:59,110
I will go to find my own value on my own.

2066
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,120
So,

2067
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,700
this is the end.

2068
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:19,590
I had a really shameful dream.

2069
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:22,350
Might be because too many things happened
during the school festival.

2070
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:30,310
It's so daring for me!

2071
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,900
He will forgive me.

2072
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,980
The last time we create
some memories together.

2073
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,990
It's not the time for me
to cling to the old days.

2074
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:40,360
With this,

2075
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,700
I feel like I can move forward too.

2076
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:45,990
With this,

2077
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:47,830
I also...

2078
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,050

School Festival of Asahi Senior School,

closing party,

2084
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:07,680
and all schedules are over.

Thorough leadership!)

(Mr. Mudo Jinnosuke)
(Special Lecture)

2092
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:23,320
Thanks for your instruction
at that time, Mr. Mudo.

2093
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,240
Wonderful!

2094
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,410
How stoic you are to study

2095
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,410
during such a festival.

2096
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,830
Well...

2097
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:32,330
Well, I want to go to college

2098
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:33,750
and become a teacher.

2099
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,840
The same path as my mother I longed for.

2100
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,880
My mom was also a teacher.

2101
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,050
I knew.

2102
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:41,630
Eh?

2103
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:44,970
I was her homeroom teacher.

2104
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:48,850
You look exactly the same as
your mother when she was young.

2105
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:50,390
Exactly the same...

2106
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:54,020
Yes, to some distorted extent.

2107
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:56,230
She was admiring me

2108
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:59,070
and went on to a teaching job
that didn't suit her.

2109
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:02,360
She's been regretting that until the end.

2110
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,910
My life

2111
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,370
was full of mistakes.

2112
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:11,580
If you simply just want to
step the path of your mom,

2113
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:12,910
then I don't recommend it.

2114
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,790
Brother,

2115
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:18,040
was there really a fire at the stall?

2116
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,170
Ah.

2117
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:20,800
No one was hurt though.

2118
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,510
That's the most important.

2119
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,220
By the way, Futarou.

2120
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,600
Didn't you see a strange old man
during the school festival?

2121
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:28,300
Eh?

2122
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,350
That's right.

2123
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:31,770
Dad has been saying about him
all the time today.

2124
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:33,980
It's fine if you didn't see him.

2125
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,730
Like this, his beard is thick.

2126
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:37,690
Ah!

2127
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:41,230
You mean the one whose face would be
more like a normal face if it's turned upside down?

2128
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,200
He really came.

2129
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,280
Who is that old man?

2130
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,870
Maybe I should have told you...

2131
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:50,660
(The Second Day of the School Festival)

2132
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,400
Second day of the school festival

2133
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,350
(The Second Day of the School Festival)
That man is...

2134
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,120
What's the matter?

2135
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:59,250
I kept considering when to confide in you.

2136
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:02,510
You mother was my former student.

2137
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:04,550
And my former colleague.

2138
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:05,590
And...

2139
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:07,720
My ex-wife.

2140
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:09,640
Which means, I am

2141
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,560
your father.

2142
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:13,430
Father?

2143
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,690
I was hoping to meet you.

2144
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:19,940
I was traveling around the country

2145
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:22,820
while thinking of you girls
at somewhere I didn't know.

2146
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,690
Once

2147
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:27,450
I saw Ichika on TV.

2148
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:30,070
Then I realized now is the time
I take the responsibility as a father.

2149
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:31,410
Why now!

2150
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:34,500
I heard about you from mom.

2151
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:36,410
As soon as you found out

2152
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:37,960
that mom was having a quintuplet,

2153
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,170
you disappeared!

2154
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:40,880
At that time,

2155
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,130
what was mom feeling like?

2156
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,050
To you, I...

2157
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:46,920
Sorry!

2158
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,390
Please let me atone for my sins.

2159
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:50,600
Even from now,

2160
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,350
I want to do anything I can
to my daughters as a father.

2161
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,190
Don't get involved with us anymore.

2162
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,270
We already have a father.

2163
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:01,480
Is it Nakano?

2164
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:03,900
When your mother died,

2165
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,110
what did he do to you?

2166
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,950
He lets the daughters keep chasing
the shadow of their dead mom,

2167
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:14,870
and step into the same wrong way with your mom.

2168
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:19,670
Being a teacher is not suitable for you.

2169
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:22,670
You should know it the best.

2170
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,420
I can't pretermit it as your father.

2171
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,010
My love towards you all

2172
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:30,720
drives me to do so!

2173
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:35,890
Itsuki?

2174
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:36,890
Yes.

2175
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:38,600
How can I say?

2176
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,400
Is she the same as usual?

2177
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:43,310
I haven't seen her from yesterday,
so I don't know.

2178
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,110
What's the matter?

2179
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,360
I suspect that your biological father

2180
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:48,860
has contacted Itsuki.

2181
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:49,490
Are you kidding?

2182
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:50,780
Why?

2183
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:56,420
Third day of the School Festival

2184
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:56,370
(The Third Day of the School Festival)

2185
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:58,040
(The Third Day of the School Festival)
Itsuki hasn't come yet.

2186
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:00,040
It is the last day today.

2187
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,580
What's the matter?

2188
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:04,090
She's been keeping herself
inside her room since yesterday.

2189
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:05,750
I see.

2190
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:07,460
Wait.

2191
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,420
Eh?

2192
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:10,170
Are you going for Itsuki?

2193
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,510
Take this.

2194
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:12,930
Is it okay?

2195
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,050
That's why you are Fu.

2196
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:16,760
You enjoy doing such things.

2197
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,810
I entrust you with her.

2198
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:20,640
Pleas take care of Itsuki.

2199
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,200
You...

2200
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:33,530
Uesugi...

2201
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,030
Although I know it's meaningless,

2202
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:38,330
why am I still doing this?

2203
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:41,410
Don't mind about that old man.

2204
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,620
He thought he said appreciate words anyway
but it's wrong...

2205
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,210
Mom also said the same.

2206
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:46,710
Itsuki...

2207
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:50,800
You must no be like me.

2208
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:55,390
Even though I still can't give up.

2209
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:58,390
I've been taking my mom as
my goal all the time.

2210
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,310
Am I wrong having

2211
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,020
a dream like that?

2212
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,730
It may be true.

2213
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:08,650
It could be no good to become a teacher.

2214
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:12,610
It will make you realize that
not only excellent students,

2215
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:13,860
in the whole world,

2216
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:16,700
there are also some unimaginable idiots.

2217
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:17,330
(Be cuter in smooth photos)

2218
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:19,290
(Be cuter in smooth photos)
You'll still have to follow up them

2219
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:21,220
(Be cuter in smooth photos)
even if it means to alter your principles.

2220
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,160
There is no doubt
that getting involved with others

2221
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:26,130
will make you tired
both physically and mentally.

2222
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,880
(Biological defense mechanism by barrier)
Among them,

2223
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,670
(Biological defense mechanism by barrier)
there may also be some rebellious students.

2224
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:31,960
Even before them, you can't escape,

2225
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,760
and have to continue to face it.

2226
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:35,970
It's really a hard work.

2227
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:37,850
I have had enough of it.

2228
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,430
I will never become a teacher.

2229
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,520
But so what?

2230
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,140
It's worthless to listen to
others' playful words.

2231
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,900
It's your own dream!

2232
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,020
No matter how adverse it is,

2233
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:51,530
it's you who decide
whether to go ahead or give up.

2234
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:55,030
Is it really my dream?

2235
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:57,910
I just want to become someone like mom.

2236
01:10:58,530 --> 01:10:59,280
Before,

2237
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:01,490
I've been told by someone.

2238
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:04,370
Pursuing your dream
while aiming for your mom

2239
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:07,580
is totally different from following
your mom's steps while aiming for your dream.

2240
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:10,920
If you can understand it,

2241
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:13,760
admiring and aiming for your parents

2242
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,380
are definitely nothing wrong.

2243
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,890
I...

2244
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:22,270
I want to become a teacher like my mom!

2245
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,230
On my own will,

2246
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:25,690
I am aiming for mom!

2247
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,560
If my student wishes so,

2248
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:31,650
as a tutor, I have only one thing I can do.

2249
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,480
To support you with whole heart.

2250
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:34,900
Only that.

2251
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:36,860
Uesugi.

2252
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,070
I came up with something good.

2253
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:45,080
Please help me with my study.

2254
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:47,500
Of course.

2255
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:49,670
Thank you.

2256
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,590
But, before that...

2257
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:55,720
(Chicken Steak)

2258
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,260
I have got something I have to do.

2259
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,600
Good afternoon, Mr. Mudo.

2260
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:06,390
Hi!

2261
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,520
I didn't expect Itsuki you,
out of the five girls, would come to me first.

2262
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:16,150
You started to listen to your father's words.

2263
01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:18,070
Is it okay to say that?

2264
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:22,370
Father? Stop joking!

2265
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:24,120
You are...

2266
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:26,950
Oops! Mr. Mudo, long time no see.

2267
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:28,210
Although,

2268
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,670
looks like we're not the ones
who have a need here.

2269
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:34,090
Mr. Mudo.

2270
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:36,170
You look good.

2271
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,720
Nakano...

2272
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:41,090
It's good to have a chance to
apologize to you.

2273
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:44,010
Because I've caused you
so much trouble.

2274
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,730
I am sorry.

2275
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:48,890
No.

2276
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:50,890
I am thankful to you.

2277
01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:51,900
Huh?

2278
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,150
It's your irresponsibility

2279
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:56,610
that brought my daughters and me together.

2280
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:58,400
I'm not sure about that.

2281
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:00,610
Regarding responsibility,

2282
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:03,370
you don't seem to be able to take it either.

2283
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:06,540
That's why Itsuki came here by herself.

2284
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,200
Not to you who is unreliable,

2285
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,710
but came to me.

2286
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:12,000
Itsuki is here?

2287
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:15,170
What are you talking about?

2288
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,880
Look carefully.

2289
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,420
Itsuki is not here.

2290
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:22,430
Huh?

2291
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:25,550
I'm here.

2292
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,270
What's your purpose?

2293
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,350
Sorry to deceive you.

2294
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,100
But I knew it would turn out like this.

2295
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,230
So what?

2296
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:37,610
I just took you wrong.

2297
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:40,190
If there's love,
he could have distinguished us.

2298
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,740
That's what mom said.

2299
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,740
Her words again!

2300
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,160
Enough!

2301
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,790
That casual nonsense.

2302
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:50,660
How long will you keep believing?!

2303
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,960
Forget it now!

2304
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,210
She should say this as a mother.

2305
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:56,380
Try to remember.

2306
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:58,460
What did she say.

2307
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:03,550
I remember mom was talking about regret.

2308
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,600
Yes! Your mom was wrong!

2309
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,260
You can't be like that!

2310
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:10,060
I don't think so.

2311
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:12,890
Even if

2312
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:15,400
my mom really denied her whole life,

2313
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:17,310
I will deny that!

2314
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:18,940
It's fine.

2315
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:21,150
Because we are not mom.

2316
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,320
Because we have seen it with our own eyes.

2317
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:27,200
We've seen mom's figure
who discarded everything.

2318
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:30,240
There should be nothing wrong with

2319
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,290
the life of someone as kind as her.

2320
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:34,750
You kid talking like you know everything.

2321
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:38,210
You also have been talking in a way
as you know it all.

2322
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:41,260
You don't know how much hope

2323
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:44,760
she found in her children after that.

2324
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:47,890
You are not qualified to talk about her.

2325
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,180
Dad.

2326
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:52,180
Mr. Mudo.

2327
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:54,390
Even if at a final moment like now,

2328
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:56,810
I guess you don't have any apologies
for my mom, right?

2329
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:01,070
I will never forgive you.

2330
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,320
It can't be a piece of the atonement for your sin.

2331
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:06,410
The day you can be released
from ditching mom will never come!

2332
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:10,160
I came here specially...

2333
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:12,240
It's unsightly, old man.

2334
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,790
Bleh!

2335
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:24,670
So it's all cleaned up?

2336
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:27,470
You being you,

2337
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:29,260
everything was witnessed
by you from not far, right?

2338
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:30,350
Well.

2339
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,470
Uesugi, thank you.

2340
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:35,980
From the death of mom,

2341
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:38,100
to fill that loneliness,

2342
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,440
I was trying to impersonate my mom.

2343
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,650
Before I can notice,

2344
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:44,400
the line between mom and me

2345
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,860
has become ambiguous.

2346
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,530
I didn't have confidence

2347
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,870
even in my own dream.

2348
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:52,740
I

2349
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:55,660
don't have to forget about mom!

2350
01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:00,540
It's you who taught me about this.

2351
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,340
Ugh!

2352
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,210
Thank you!

2353
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:10,470
The sky is so dark before I know it.

2354
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,050
It's already winter now.

2355
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,480
What's the matter suddenly?

2356
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,850
It's creepy.

2357
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:22,060
All is blamed on me, sorry.

2358
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:23,320
Anyway,

2359
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:26,070
Thanks to you that I became confident.

2360
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:28,400
I am not mom.

2361
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:30,990
It's because of you that I could

2362
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,410
realize such a simple thing.

2363
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:35,950
Although the ideal teacher image of mine

2364
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:37,540
is still like mom...

2365
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:39,120
What?

2366
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:41,290
Well...

2367
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:42,330
In a word,

2368
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:44,130
Uesugi...

2369
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,050
You are also ideal for me.

2370
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:50,090
I just wanted you to hear that.

2371
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,010
Then,

2372
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:56,020
time for the announcement of the best stall!

2373
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:56,270
(Announcement of the Best Stall)

2374
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:56,340
Best Stall Result

2375
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:57,390
(Class 1 Grade 3)

2376
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,460
Class 3 - Group 1

2377
01:16:57,390 --> 01:16:58,980
Yay! We did it!

2378
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:00,730
Eh?

2379
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,860
Where are the Nakano sisters?

2380
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:04,650
Sorry to keep you waiting.

2381
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,940
Itsuki, how's it going?

2382
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:11,320
Did you tell Futarou about that?

2383
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:12,360
Yes.

2384
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:15,200
And I also thanked him for dad's affair.

2385
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:17,450
Thank you all again.

2386
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:19,120
It's fine. Never mind.

2387
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,750
It was also a problem for our family.

2388
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,750
B...But...

2389
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,380
Thank...

2390
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:27,250
Thank you!

2391
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,260
I could only feel discomfort from that.

2392
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:32,550
What? Girls...

2393
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,220
Ah, Miku even disguised like me.

2394
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:36,470
Never mind.

2395
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:39,890
Besides, I'm not satisfied with
such a slipshod disguise.

2396
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:43,190
I see in her there's a mysterious pride
exclusive to her sprouting.

2397
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:46,650
The usual people
will make a mistake just by that.

2398
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,780
The face is still the same
even if the contents are different.

2399
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:55,120
We will always be a quintuplet.

2400
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:01,460
Hey!

2401
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:04,120
There's still time
before the appointment with Futarou.

2402
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,540
Let's change the mood.

2403
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:08,590
Ah...

2404
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:11,130
How long do you want to sit still here?

2405
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:13,680
How about getting some food at the stalls?

2406
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,430
Stalls? Right.

2407
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:18,510
I didn't eat anything.

2408
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:21,060
And there's some stalls I haven't visited.

2409
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:23,270
After that, I...

2410
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:25,810
Still have someone to meet.

2411
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:27,150
I see.

2412
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,730
I just saw them if you mean the sisters.

2413
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:32,700
The five are all gathered
as Ichika was also here.

2414
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,320
Eh, Maeda?

2415
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,160
You figured out Ichika properly in a second.

2416
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,490
W...Well.

2417
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:41,500
It maybe weird,

2418
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,870
I always could

2419
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:44,330
somehow distinguish Ichika and her only.

2420
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:46,170
Of course Uesugi,

2421
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:47,380
you can figure them out, right?

2422
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:48,000
Huh?

2423
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:51,460
Since you bring that up,
I can't say I'm confident.

2424
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:54,510
I was much more confused than now at first.

2425
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:58,180
To make matters worse,
I'm not good at remembering people's faces.

2426
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,680
In addition,

2427
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,640
they took full advantage of it.

2428
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:05,100
How many times have I been deceived?

2429
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:08,020
Those who are troublesome until the end.

2430
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,230
So bold of you to say that.

2431
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:12,530
I got really curious suddenly.

2432
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,650
Since who of the five girls

2433
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:16,530
did you start to be able to distinguish them?

2434
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,290
Well, let's go to the stalls.

2435
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:23,700
Wait.

2436
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,370
What's up for now?

2437
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:27,790
Hey, Takeda, what does it mean?

2438
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:30,920
You should ask Uesugi about what it means.

2439
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:32,500
It was nothing.

2440
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:35,010
Aren't you too aloof, Uesugi?

2441
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:37,380
Secrets are not allowable between us!

2442
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,100
Annoying! That's a secret! Secret!

2443
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,010
You like one?

2444
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:43,680
One of the quintuplets.

2445
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:50,110
It is the role of a student to study.

2446
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:53,480
I have grown up believing
that everything else is unnecessary.

2447
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:54,780
But,

2448
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,400
there's no need to discard anything else.

2449
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,530
Be it study and friendship,

2450
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:01,830
work, entertainment and love,

2451
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,620
they were always doing their best.

2452
01:20:05,790 --> 01:20:07,290
They taught me that,

2453
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:09,460
filling with the entrenched idea about that.

2454
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:13,210
It's just that I've been keeping them waiting

2455
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:15,340
before I finally realized that not long ago.

2456
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:18,260
If it's the precious me,

2457
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:21,180
I'd still be alone at this moment.

2458
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:23,930
Uesugi...

2459
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,730
Well! Let's go to the stalls!

2460
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:28,440
Although I have no money.

2461
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:32,730
Why are you going to the stalls without money?

2462
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:35,280
The resting place really helps!

2463
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:35,940
Yes!

2464
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:38,070
I've decided.

2465
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:41,570
To enjoy this festival until the end.

2466
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,580
It's almost the time.

2467
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,680
Uesugi,

2468
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:07,140
after everything is over today,

2469
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,230
we will be in each room

2470
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,560
harboring the though of our own

2471
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,520
and waiting for you.

2472
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:20,150
You can head for

2473
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:22,160
only one classroom.

2474
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:25,990
We know that this idea

2475
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:29,370
will confuse you on the contrary.

2476
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:31,960
But this is our resolution.

2477
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:34,080
Please.

2478
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:36,210
Please understand it.

2479
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:42,260
Until now,

2480
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:44,180
School Festival of Asahi Senior School,

2481
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:45,220
closing party,

2482
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:47,600
and all schedules are over.

2483
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:03,910
Uesugi.

2484
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:06,910
You rock, Futarou!

2485
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:10,000
Ah!

2486
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:16,670
It's over.

2487
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,630
So at that time...

2488
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:24,720
You have already decided.

2489
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,770
This is just the beginning, Uesugi.

2490
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:46,410
Here it is.

2491
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:49,450
Hi.

2492
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:51,120
Huh?

2493
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:56,250
I've been waiting for you.

2494
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:57,290
Eh?

2495
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,090
Uesugi, why are you here?

2496
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:01,920
I came to see you.

2497
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:02,840
Yotsuba.

2498
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:06,430
You are joking, right?

2499
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,390
Y...You must be joking!

2500
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:12,060
That's impossible!

2501
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:13,310
You're right.

2502
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,560
I wonder why it turned out to be like this.

2503
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,060
Speaking of that, I'm the one
who've been waiting for long.

2504
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:20,860
Why weren't you here?

2505
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,150
Because...

2506
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:24,820
I wasn't expecting your arrival
in any possible way.

2507
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:27,160
I specially bought
the fresh-made fried chicken.

2508
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:28,950
That is...

2509
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,120
Didn't you give me the tickets?

2510
01:23:31,870 --> 01:23:32,490
Here,

2511
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:33,700
enjoy yourself.

2512
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:35,710
Have you been waiting all the time?

2513
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:36,830
Yes.

2514
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,540
I decided to eat with you here.

2515
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:48,340
So...

2516
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:50,680
After getting to know this result,

2517
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,230
I'd like to ask.

2518
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,320
You...

2519
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:54,600
Sorry!

2520
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:55,180
Ouch!

2521
01:23:59,060 --> 01:23:59,690
Eh?

2522
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:01,190
Uesugi?

2523
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:04,940
Hey, Uesugi.

2524
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:07,450
I plucked up my courage and came here.

2525
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:09,570
I didn't expect to be answered instantly.

2526
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:15,250
Well, I got your feeling to me.

2527
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,250
I'm so honored, but...

2528
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:18,290
Huh?

2529
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:21,790
There should be someone better for you!

2530
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:24,210
It's a waste to settle by me.

2531
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:27,130
What's going on?

2532
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:30,930
Well, instead of me, the others are...

2533
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,180
The others?

2534
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:37,230
I'm asking you right now.

2535
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:40,230
Tell me your feelings.

2536
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:45,400
Hey, you!

2537
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:54,160
She fled.

2538
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:55,660
Uesugi.

2539
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:56,790
Oh!

2540
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:57,910
Itsuki!

2541
01:24:58,290 --> 01:24:59,410
Where is she?

2542
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:02,330
I saw Yotsuba running that way.

2543
01:25:03,290 --> 01:25:05,750
There's only one destination
you should head for.

2544
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:09,970
Extra consideration could only hurt her.

2545
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,300
That's right.

2546
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:14,930
Excuse me.

2547
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:19,640
Yotsuba...

2548
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:21,650
You always said that.

2549
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:23,610
Again and again.

2550
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:24,940
It even got annoying.

2551
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:28,690
Let's make it a school camping trip
with no regrets.

2552
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,860
Let's make it a school excursion
with no regrets.

2553
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:35,830
Let's make it a school festival
that will not leave any regrets.

2554
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:38,410
I won't give up!

2555
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:46,710
W...Wait!

2556
01:25:46,710 --> 01:25:48,340
Sorry, Uesugi.

2557
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:51,380
I can't be the special one.

2558
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:53,890
A girl like me...

2559
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,680
Nino.

2560
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:01,350
Where are you?

2561
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:01,980
Ah!

2562
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:04,650
It hurts.

2563
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:05,520
Oops!

2564
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:07,360
Sorry!

2565
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,900
No, I didn't pay attention either.

2566
01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:11,110
Sorry.

2567
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:14,910
Ah, it's already this late.

2568
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:15,990
Anyway,

2569
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,580
let's take the bus home.

2570
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:18,240
Ah.

2571
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:19,330
Huh?

2572
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,790
I've spent all my money

2573
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:23,750
on the amulet I bought at the daytime.

2574
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,330
Are you a fool?

2575
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:27,530
I've told you I only have...

2576
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:29,550
200 Yen.

2577
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:30,710
I can't lend it to you.

2578
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,720
I knew.

2579
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:34,380
Take care.

2580
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:35,430
Huh?

2581
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:44,770
Oops, it's gone.

2582
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:47,690
My family is poor.

2583
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:49,690
I always donated just 5 yen.

2584
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:50,980
Petty, isn't it?

2585
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:54,650
Futarou, don't you feel sad with your money gone?

2586
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:56,660
What do you mean?

2587
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:58,620
It's the same with my family.

2588
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,490
For the whole family,

2589
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:02,910
my mom has worked all by herself.

2590
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:04,160
So...

2591
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:06,080
Sometimes I wonder...

2592
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,210
Without me...

2593
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:10,750
If mom can be more relieved.

2594
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,090
You...

2595
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:13,220
So,

2596
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:15,300
I will study hard,

2597
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,890
become super smart,

2598
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:19,970
get into a company that pays well

2599
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:22,100
and make it easier for my mom!

2600
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:24,060
At that time, I'm sure

2601
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:27,150
I'll make my existence meaningful.

2602
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,610
Amazing!

2603
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,860
You talk like an adult.

2604
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:32,480
- Eh?
- That's right!

2605
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:34,440
If I study hard,

2606
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:35,700
become smart,

2607
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:37,450
and be able to make money too.

2608
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:41,080
I might be able to let my sister live
without any inconvenience.

2609
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:43,750
Maybe I can become someone necessary!

2610
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:48,080
Let's try together!

2611
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,710
I, for my mom,

2612
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,420
you, for your sister.

2613
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:55,420
Let's study with all our strength!

2614
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:00,140
Yea.

2615
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:01,600
Well,

2616
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:04,220
100 yen each for you and me,

2617
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:06,140
let's pray to the god for that!

2618
01:28:25,330 --> 01:28:26,080
Yotsuba...

2619
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:26,790
Eh!

2620
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,500
That ribbon suits you very much.

2621
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:32,540
Thank you.

2622
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,670
Then you won't take me wrong with the others.

2623
01:28:36,090 --> 01:28:37,720
Well, I can't promise that.

2624
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:38,340
Huh?

2625
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:40,970
What you are wearing

2626
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:42,550
is not that big a difference.

2627
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,390
Not only this!

2628
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,680
I will study harder than others.

2629
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,190
I'm the top 1 in last test.

2630
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:50,900
I won, right?

2631
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:54,020
I'm no longer
in the same position with the others.

2632
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:55,650
I'm not exactly the same!

2633
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:57,570
Mom!

2634
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:59,150
Look, look!

2635
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:01,570
Eh, they're very cute.

2636
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:04,370
Like what Yotsuba is doing, I put these on.

2637
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:05,700
Yotsuba,

2638
01:29:05,990 --> 01:29:08,040
your hard working is wonderful

2639
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,960
and is nothing wrong.

2640
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:13,250
Even if not the best,

2641
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:15,960
each of you is special.

2642
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,470
As your parent, I hope

2643
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:22,090
you can all be together.

2644
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:25,260
No matter what happens.

2645
01:29:25,810 --> 01:29:28,270
It's not the most important
where you are.

2646
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:30,280
It's important
that all of you five stay together.

2647
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:40,450
She didn't get well at all.

2648
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:44,410
Excuse me.

2649
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:53,880
It's the first time

2650
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,000
we speak like this.

2651
01:29:57,170 --> 01:29:58,210
I will take the responsibility

2652
01:29:58,210 --> 01:30:00,420
and take care of you.

2653
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:02,720
Mom...

2654
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:05,720
We've become junior school students.

2655
01:30:06,430 --> 01:30:07,310
But,

2656
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:10,680
it's impossible for all of us to be together.

2657
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:13,190
We

2658
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:15,150
can't stay together anymore.

2659
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:17,860
Dad, look!

2660
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:19,480
In the last exam,

2661
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,780
I was the best among the five of us!

2662
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:22,860
Well done.

2663
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:26,320
The track-and-field sports club invited me,
but I refused.

2664
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,490
But it can't be helped
as I have to focus on study.

2665
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:31,620
Keep that spirit and move on.

2666
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,960
Hum, he's so cold.

2667
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:40,170
If it were mom, I would be praised much more.

2668
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:43,930
I would be praised, right...

2669
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:50,560
Futarou must be studying for now.

2670
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:54,060
Yotsuba, don't you need them anymore?

2671
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:57,480
Yes, because they will
interfere with my study.

2672
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,980
So, can I borrow them?

2673
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,360
Good, I'm progressing steadily.

2674
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:05,950
I will work harder from now on!

2675
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,200
Yotsuba!

2676
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,580
I got this score in the history exam!

2677
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:11,660
(Nakano Miku 42 points)

2678
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:12,410
(Nakano Miku 42 points)
All thanks to the games you lent to me.

2679
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:14,210
All thanks to the games you lent to me.

2680
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:16,620
R...Really?

2681
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,000
That's great...

2682
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,170
I have to try harder!

2683
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,300
Study hard,

2684
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:25,090
become super smart,

2685
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:29,100
get into a company that pays well...

2686
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:35,350
What am I studying for?

2687
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,900
You don't need to be special.

2688
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:39,520
It's important

2689
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,070
that all of you five stay together.

2690
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:44,320
Why is it important that we stay together?

2691
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:46,650
I can't understand.

2692
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:50,950
Everyone from track-and-field sports club of

2693
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:52,580
Black Rose Girls High School.

2694
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,750
Congratulations on your admission to

2695
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,160
the inter-high school competition.

2696
01:31:56,830 --> 01:31:58,630
Mom, look.

2697
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:01,340
I'm praised by everyone!

2698
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:01,380
(Congratulations to basketball club
on advancing to the national tournament)

2699
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:03,820
(Congratulations to basketball club
on advancing to the national tournament)
I am reckoned as necessary by many people!

2700
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:06,260
Not any one else of my sisters,

2701
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:07,800
It's me!

2702
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:10,800
You have been practicing all the time recently.

2703
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:13,100
Are you okay? Is it okay with your study?

2704
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,930
If you like,

2705
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:16,520
I can teach you.

2706
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:19,020
I am different with you all now!

2707
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:22,610
Don't stay with me.

2708
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:26,240
I'm the best of our sisters.

2709
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:27,900
I'm special!

2710
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:30,410
You failed the second makeup exam.

2711
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:32,200
Nakano Yotsuba,

2712
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:34,490
you have to repeat the year.

2713
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:41,000
That's a joke, right?

2714
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,630
No, it's true.

2715
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:43,840
But

2716
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,050
I have won so many prizes
in club activities.

2717
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:47,580
At the basketball club, I have just...

2718
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:48,840
They're irrelevant.

2719
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:51,800
You should have been warned repeatedly.

2720
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:55,140
But you didn't stop joining in multiple clubs.

2721
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,310
Pack your luggage.

2722
01:32:58,890 --> 01:32:59,600
(Principal's Office)

2723
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:00,140
(Principal's Office)
Eh?

2724
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:01,600
Transferring?

2725
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:04,150
It's a coeducational school

2726
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:05,900
where my acquaintance works as a director.

2727
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:07,570
From the end of summer vacation,

2728
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:09,490
you will start to study there.

2729
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:12,490
Only me?

2730
01:33:13,450 --> 01:33:14,120
Eh?

2731
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:16,740
I should be special...

2732
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:19,910
I was trying so desperately

2733
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:21,750
to make my existence meaningful.

2734
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:24,540
Why am I alone?

2735
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,420
If I'm alone,

2736
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,460
what should I do?

2737
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:30,970
What should I do to be special?

2738
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:34,850
I don't know where should I head for.

2739
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:37,930
Wait.

2740
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:38,730
Ah!

2741
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:42,650
If Yotsuba transfers,

2742
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:44,900
we will go with her.

2743
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:47,900
What are you saying?

2744
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:50,190
You should have passed the exam.

2745
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,320
Yes, we passed.

2746
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:54,410
Thanks to "cheating".

2747
01:33:55,950 --> 01:33:58,160
I...Is that true?

2748
01:33:59,450 --> 01:34:01,370
We too.

2749
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:02,670
Girls...

2750
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:03,830
Why?

2751
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,880
Why do you do that for me?

2752
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:07,000
Yotsuba,

2753
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:10,050
although I don't know
what you are thinking.

2754
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:13,680
Leaving by your own
is something I absolutely hate!

2755
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:17,390
We will always stay together
wherever we go.

2756
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:20,560
That is what mom has taught us.

2757
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:24,440
Yotsuba...

2758
01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:28,440
Everything can be divided into
five equal parts by all of us.

2759
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,030
Even difficulties

2760
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:34,070
can be overcome by we five.

2761
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:36,950
Now I understand

2762
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:38,740
what my mom's words mean.

2763
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:43,750
Stop thinking about who's the best.

2764
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:47,540
I'll live on for everyone.

2765
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:51,550
Eh?

2766
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,470
100 points?

2767
01:35:12,690 --> 01:35:14,150
W...Wait!

2768
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:15,490
Because of all my sisters,

2769
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:17,910
I can be who I am currently.

2770
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,660
Both that memory and this feeling,

2771
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:21,790
I'll just erase them.

2772
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:27,040
Ouch!

2773
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:29,670
Ah!

2774
01:35:35,470 --> 01:35:37,010
Are you okay?

2775
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:41,930
Your sisters are all so nice,

2776
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:43,220
so amazing,

2777
01:35:43,470 --> 01:35:44,810
and girls I like so much.

2778
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:49,730
I'm proud of being your tutor.

2779
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,650
But... If there weren't you,

2780
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:56,610
I would have stumbled already.

2781
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:02,620
Why did you say so?

2782
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:04,950
I am so infirm a person.

2783
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:08,080
I will continue to stumble
for many times in the future.

2784
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,460
It's a selfish wish of me who is so wack.

2785
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:13,710
At such moments, Yotsuba,

2786
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:16,760
I would be happy if you are by my side.

2787
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:20,220
I would be relieved.

2788
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:22,970
You are my support.

2789
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:25,730
I also want to become your support.

2790
01:36:26,730 --> 01:36:28,560
So, it's fine if you dislike it.

2791
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:31,230
Please tell me your feeling.

2792
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:37,150
I...

2793
01:36:37,950 --> 01:36:39,410
Uesugi.

2794
01:36:40,530 --> 01:36:41,660
Say it

2795
01:36:42,370 --> 01:36:44,040
and put an end to all these.

2796
01:36:45,330 --> 01:36:47,330
I hate Uesugi.

2797
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:50,670
Hate... Hate... Hate...

2798
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:54,960
I like you!

2799
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:57,630
I...

2800
01:36:57,970 --> 01:36:59,550
can't...

2801
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:01,010
tell lies to you.

2802
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:06,140
I have been in love with you.

2803
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:11,690
But...

2804
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:13,020
Sorry.

2805
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:13,860
Ah!

2806
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,980
There's still something I have to do.

2807
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:21,030
(Math) (Nakano Ichika)

2808
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:22,990
(Math) (Nakano Ichika)
Eh? You are not dating?

2809
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:24,990
Actually...

2810
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:26,830
I see.

2811
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,910
You are not dating.

2812
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:31,830
If so,

2813
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:33,880
Futarou still

2814
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,800
doesn't belong to anyone.

2815
01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:42,390
Hey, cheer up!

2816
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,890
Didn't Yotsuba say she likes you?

2817
01:37:44,890 --> 01:37:46,600
Then it's a mutual love.

2818
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,810
You may be disliked if you worry too much.

2819
01:37:52,270 --> 01:37:52,980
Right.

2820
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:54,860
Thank you.

2821
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:55,770
Ichika.

2822
01:37:58,780 --> 01:38:01,860
Even if someday he chose you,

2823
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:04,120
I would be willing to congratulate you.

2824
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:06,780
I came to understand

2825
01:38:07,370 --> 01:38:08,870
what Nino said before.

2826
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,040
You should have known

2827
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:13,540
that I have been in love with Fu.

2828
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:16,790
You must have known that
and waited for yesterday, right?

2829
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:19,960
I don't want and need your concern anymore.

2830
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:21,470
But I am concerned.

2831
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:23,590
Nino, you are an important family for me!

2832
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:25,890
If so,

2833
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:27,760
it's done for you and me.

2834
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:31,430
If you two keep that way,

2835
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:32,980
the relationship of sisters

2836
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:34,440
will be cut off.

2837
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:40,990
Yotsuba.

2838
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:43,240
Your body will get cold

2839
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:45,200
if you stay here.

2840
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,280
Miku.

2841
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:47,910
I am Yotsuba.

2842
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:50,750
I am Yotsuba.

2843
01:38:51,370 --> 01:38:52,460
What?

2844
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:55,210
I was thinking.

2845
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,920
As he didn't choose me,

2846
01:38:58,250 --> 01:38:59,710
I could just dress like Yotsuba

2847
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:02,130
and date Futarou. That's my plan.

2848
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:04,680
How about it?

2849
01:39:10,810 --> 01:39:12,060
I don't think it'll work.

2850
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:14,390
Moralistically.

2851
01:39:18,310 --> 01:39:20,150
C...Cold...

2852
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:22,780
Let's change the place.

2853
01:39:26,410 --> 01:39:28,700
It's the first time

2854
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:29,990
that only two of us come to the karaoke.

2855
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:35,750
Yotsuba.

2856
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,000
What?

2857
01:39:38,290 --> 01:39:39,540
I was just joking.

2858
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:42,550
Dressing up like Yotsuba

2859
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:43,340
is a joke.

2860
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:46,880
Although I can imitate Yotsuba,

2861
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,300
I can't become you.

2862
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:49,900
This juice

2863
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:51,720
is too sweet for me.

2864
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:53,250
Miku...

2865
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:54,680
But I'm mad at you.

2866
01:39:55,730 --> 01:39:56,810
If it's me,

2867
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:59,440
I won't do anything
that will confuse Futarou.

2868
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:03,070
You are hesitating about the answer, right?

2869
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:05,110
I thought your favorable feeling
towards Futarou

2870
01:40:05,110 --> 01:40:07,910
should not be a little.

2871
01:40:08,410 --> 01:40:09,620
I'm not hesitating.

2872
01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:13,330
My feelings have never changed
since before.

2873
01:40:13,870 --> 01:40:16,370
I have been thinking about Uesugi.

2874
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,540
If that's the case,

2875
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:21,750
there should be less reasons
for you to hesitate.

2876
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:23,550
Are you still minding

2877
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:25,670
what happened in the previous school?

2878
01:40:28,630 --> 01:40:30,680
Don't mind us.

2879
01:40:30,970 --> 01:40:32,430
It's fine to date him.

2880
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,260
Ah...

2881
01:40:34,810 --> 01:40:36,980
You thought I'd say something like that?

2882
01:40:38,690 --> 01:40:40,650
I knew I should...

2883
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:41,940
However,

2884
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,070
what is regrettable is regrettable.

2885
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:45,740
Whatever,

2886
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:47,530
I couldn't help but feel intense inside.

2887
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:49,610
That's my true feelings.

2888
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:51,660
If...

2889
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:53,660
Yotsuba also thinks so,

2890
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:57,290
I hope you can also take
the feelings of us.

2891
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,290
Nino's feelings.

2892
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,420
I didn't manage to understand it.

2893
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:06,960
It's natural that she got mad.

2894
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:08,760
Nino said so.

2895
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:10,300
Because of love,

2896
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:13,510
we are not enemies or companions.

2897
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:16,520
I see.

2898
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:18,730
If you can think that way,

2899
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:20,770
then please forgive our last resistance.

2900
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:22,900
Absolutely,

2901
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:25,320
we can never give you any supportive nudge.

2902
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:30,530
It's rare chance. So let's sing!

2903
01:41:31,030 --> 01:41:33,320
Right! Listen to me.

2904
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:35,450
I will sing better than you, Miku!

2905
01:41:35,450 --> 01:41:36,700
Could ask nothing better.

2906
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,210
Wow, look!

2907
01:41:42,210 --> 01:41:43,500
It's such a nice day!

2908
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:43,960
(Karaoke Samurai)

2909
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:45,630
(Karaoke Samurai)
I didn't expected to keep singing

2910
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:46,500
I didn't expected to keep singing

2911
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:47,960
all over the night.

2912
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:51,130
Hey, Miku.

2913
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:52,840
I...

2914
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:54,720
want to meet everyone!

2915
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,810
Yotsuba got one thing wrong.

2916
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:05,270
I purposely didn't tell her that.

2917
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:07,530
That time,

2918
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:10,400
she made the choice to come to this school,

2919
01:42:10,690 --> 01:42:12,070
so we could meet Futarou.

2920
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:14,950
At least

2921
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:17,030
I don't find it's unfortunate.

2922
01:42:19,370 --> 01:42:21,080
Because we could meet Futarou.

2923
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:23,830
I...

2924
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:27,550
Let's go, Yotsuba.

2925
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,050
Although

2926
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:31,670
I couldn't become Yotsuba,

2927
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:34,010
Yotsuba can't become me either.

2928
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:35,970
Finally,

2929
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:38,180
the more I think this way,

2930
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:41,100
the fonder I've become of myself.

2931
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,440
Itsuki.

2932
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:46,730
Can I have a word with you?

2933
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:49,070
What's the matter?

2934
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:51,740
Well. I have something to talk to you.

2935
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:53,780
It might not be appropriate to talk here.

2936
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:56,240
So, come here.

2937
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:02,830
Well... What do you want to say?

2938
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:12,050
S...Sorry.

2939
01:43:12,050 --> 01:43:14,550
It hurts... Well, don't mind.

2940
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:17,760
I can always feel it.

2941
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:19,760
This pent-up feeling in my chest.

2942
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,140
Is it empty here?

2943
01:43:26,190 --> 01:43:29,110
The one who disturbed
the harmony of we quintuplets.

2944
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:31,480
Yotsuba, is you.

2945
01:43:32,570 --> 01:43:34,360
Sorry to be selfish.

2946
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:36,910
I didn't think about
your feelings yesterday, Nino.

2947
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:38,620
I imposed too much on you.

2948
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:39,950
But

2949
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:42,490
I still have the same thought.

2950
01:43:43,290 --> 01:43:44,790
I hope...

2951
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:45,750
I'm shocked.

2952
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:48,040
You are still saying such naive words.

2953
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:49,670
I won't admit it...

2954
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:50,210
Eh?!

2955
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,760
Was it just a mouse?

2956
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,220
There are mice here.

2957
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:58,800
That's was close.

2958
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:01,260
Kinda impossible to open the door, right?

2959
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:03,600
Please don't get too close to me.

2960
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:05,430
In such a place,

2961
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:07,600
I don't want to be seen
by Yotsuba and the others.

2962
01:44:07,690 --> 01:44:09,940
The lunch break is almost over.

2963
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:10,880
Let's go back.

2964
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:11,850
Wait!

2965
01:44:13,070 --> 01:44:14,110
What!

2966
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:18,990
I came to tell you with my own resolution.

2967
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:20,620
I hope

2968
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:23,830
you can admit my relationship with Uesugi.

2969
01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:25,200
- I said that is...
- But!

2970
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:26,870
It doesn't have to be now!

2971
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,040
Months later...

2972
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:30,380
Years later...

2973
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:33,210
I don't know how much time it will cost,

2974
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:36,300
but I know how much
I am in love with Uesugi.

2975
01:44:36,510 --> 01:44:38,050
The strength of this feeling!

2976
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:39,510
I want to show it to you!

2977
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:41,510
I will never lose!

2978
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:44,010
That's right.

2979
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:47,850
No matter how you apologize
or persuade now,

2980
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:50,350
I can't accept it.

2981
01:44:50,810 --> 01:44:52,480
After understanding that,

2982
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:55,570
you're going on the thorny path.

2983
01:44:56,110 --> 01:44:59,530
Just as I like Uesugi,

2984
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:01,740
I also like all my sisters.

2985
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:04,790
Come on, you stupid.

2986
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:07,410
But that's as expected of Yotsuba.

2987
01:45:11,210 --> 01:45:12,680
You're now finally unleashed from the shackles

2988
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:14,630
of the quintuplets and rush forward.

2989
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:17,550
I don't like to see your back,

2990
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,050
but I'm jealous.

2991
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:22,050
Maybe you are still taking me

2992
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:24,890
as an opponent to compete.

2993
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:26,470
Of course.

2994
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:27,770
We have been growing up

2995
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:30,560
while being aware of each other.

2996
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:32,310
Sometimes we are companions.

2997
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:33,730
Sometimes we are enemies.

2998
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,070
That is...

2999
01:45:35,070 --> 01:45:35,900
We are

3000
01:45:36,650 --> 01:45:37,360
rivals!

3001
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:40,610
The game is not over here!

3002
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:42,360
I'll keep observing you two

3003
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:44,070
from a little behind.

3004
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:46,580
If even the slightest gap is shown,

3005
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:48,790
I will take him away!

3006
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:51,620
Uh-huh!

3007
01:45:53,790 --> 01:45:55,590
It's time for us to end this talk.

3008
01:45:55,590 --> 01:45:57,760
Come out, you two mice!

3009
01:45:59,050 --> 01:46:00,420
Have you found out...

3010
01:46:01,470 --> 01:46:02,930
Well, well...

3011
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:04,600
Uesugi!

3012
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:05,430
Itsuka!

3013
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,560
Were you two listening all the time?

3014
01:46:07,770 --> 01:46:08,350
Sorry.

3015
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:13,810
You heard it, right, Fu?

3016
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,150
In that case,

3017
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,570
never let you guard down.

3018
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:21,240
Well, I will bear it in mind deeply.

3019
01:46:22,030 --> 01:46:25,490
Seems you also have captured
the most difficult heart of our sisters.

3020
01:46:26,030 --> 01:46:26,760
But,

3021
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:29,080
I can finally say it.

3022
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:31,460
You

3023
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:33,170
are not alone.

3024
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:35,790
Uesugi,

3025
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:37,540
Congratulations.

3026
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:50,390
I sincerely appreciate it

3027
01:46:50,390 --> 01:46:52,020
that you invited me out.

3028
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:53,560
Sorry to ask you out during the holiday.

3029
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:55,810
N...No. Not at all.

3030
01:46:55,810 --> 01:46:56,900
I am happy.

3031
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:58,150
Really?

3032
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:03,820
After all,

3033
01:47:03,820 --> 01:47:06,200
we couldn't be alone at school.

3034
01:47:06,450 --> 01:47:08,410
Exactly.

3035
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:11,330
We don't know
if someone is listening somewhere.

3036
01:47:11,330 --> 01:47:12,830
Ouch!

3037
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:18,420
Emergency stop for falling objects check.

3038
01:47:18,710 --> 01:47:19,880
- Sorry for the inconvenience.

3039
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:21,210
- Aren't we supposed to be in the opposite positions?
- Sorry for the inconvenience.

3040
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:22,010
- Aren't we supposed to be in the opposite positions?
- Please wait a moment for the security confirmation.

3041
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:22,760
- Please wait a moment for the security confirmation.

3042
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:24,010
- Right...
- Please wait a moment for the security confirmation.

3043
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:27,430
Well, order whatever you like!

3044
01:47:27,550 --> 01:47:28,720
It's on me!

3045
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:31,310
Wow! Delicious!

3046
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:32,810
That's great.

3047
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,190
It's really irritating.

3048
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,230
Why is the destination of their date
a family restaurant?

3049
01:47:38,230 --> 01:47:40,360
I think it's fresh and good.

3050
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:41,480
Can I use this?

3051
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,900
He's using a coupon.

3052
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:43,900
Can't he?

3053
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,990
It's no good to use a coupon during a date.

3054
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:49,830
It's a way of trying for Futarou.

3055

(Vegetable Festival)

3056
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:52,830
(Vegetable Festival)
You accepted the offer of the athletic college, right?

3057
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:53,880
(The Sound of Far Mountains)
You accepted the offer of the athletic college, right?

3058
01:47:54,370 --> 01:47:55,040
Yes!

3059
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:58,080
So... is it your dream?

3060
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,670
Do you want to become an athlete?

3061
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:01,590
No.

3062
01:48:02,170 --> 01:48:05,090
I've forgotten my dream as a child.

3063
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:06,550
But after all,

3064
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:09,010
I think it will be suitable for me

3065
01:48:09,010 --> 01:48:10,640
to be helpful and supportive for others.

3066
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:13,350
I only started to think like that after giving up.

3067
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:16,600
But now I have realized
that I can be proud of that too.

3068
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,520
I see.

3069
01:48:17,690 --> 01:48:18,810
That's what you would do.

3070
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:21,400
I started to think like this

3071
01:48:21,770 --> 01:48:23,650
when you said so.

3072
01:48:24,110 --> 01:48:26,030
Is it so?

3073
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:27,030
Yes!

3074
01:48:28,450 --> 01:48:31,160
So, if I can enroll into college,

3075
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:34,330
I want to find a job
that I can support others by study.

3076
01:48:34,330 --> 01:48:36,210
Oh, Yeah.

3077
01:48:40,170 --> 01:48:42,090

Hold down, hold down.

3080
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:47,840
I'm sorry.

3081
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:49,550
It's so boring in library.

3082
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:51,180
No!

3083
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:52,720
If it's with you,

3084
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:54,930
everything is so fun.

3085
01:48:55,060 --> 01:48:55,850
Then,

3086
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,560
can you go to the last place with me?

3087
01:48:58,560 --> 01:48:59,650
Yes!

3088
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:03,270
Yotsuba,

3089
01:49:03,770 --> 01:49:06,400
it seems you're fine
without a push on your back.

3090
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:10,200
Here is...

3091
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:12,160
It's so nostalgic.

3092
01:49:16,330 --> 01:49:17,250
You

3093
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:19,410
liked this swing, right?

3094
01:49:19,410 --> 01:49:22,670
Am I not supposed to be taken to somewhere

3095
01:49:22,670 --> 01:49:24,380
you have strong feelings about today?

3096
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:25,550
Yes.

3097
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:28,260
The family restaurant my family usually visits.

3098
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:30,550
The library I usually study at.

3099
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:33,600
Since the day I came here with you,

3100
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:35,810
this place has become one of them.

3101
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:41,020
Is it okay?

3102
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:43,650
To be honest, I'm still hesitating.

3103
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:46,820
Is it OK that

3104
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:48,860
I put all my sisters aside,

3105
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,910
be so happy by myself?

3106
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:55,620
Is this a right choice?

3107
01:49:57,740 --> 01:50:00,830
You can jump so far here, right?

3108
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:02,580
Show me again!

3109
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:05,250
Okay!

3110
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:07,250
It's a piece of cake.

3111
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:13,260
Now!

3112
01:50:21,390 --> 01:50:23,650
How about it?

3113
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:24,980
Yotsuba.

3114
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:27,570
If I can jump over there,

3115
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:29,530
can I ask you something?

3116
01:50:29,530 --> 01:50:31,240
Well...

3117
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:32,150
I'm coming.

3118
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:34,240
No, don't push yourself too hard!

3119
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:35,450
Behold.

3120
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:41,660
Further...

3121
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:43,960
I should be able to go further!

3122
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:00,350
Oops!

3123
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:02,520
Died?

3124
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:04,390
Yotsuba.

3125
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:08,480
Such an inexperienced person

3126
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:10,030
who can't handle a date...

3127
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:11,360
But

3128
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:14,400
I will devote myself to become a man

3129
01:51:14,490 --> 01:51:15,490
standing next to you.

3130
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:17,990
No matter the right path

3131
01:51:17,990 --> 01:51:19,200
or the wrong path,

3132
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:21,870
let's go ahead together.

3133
01:51:22,790 --> 01:51:23,500
So,

3134
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:25,790
if you like

3135
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:27,290
come with me.

3136
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:28,670
I...

3137
01:51:32,010 --> 01:51:32,880
I love you.

3138
01:51:35,590 --> 01:51:36,890
Will you marry me?

3139
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:41,600
Eh?

3140
01:51:48,190 --> 01:51:49,610
I am so shocked!

3141
01:51:49,610 --> 01:51:51,230
I... Certainly...

3142
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:53,940
You've skipped so many steps!

3143
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:55,950
T...That's right.

3144
01:51:56,410 --> 01:51:57,320
It's too fast.

3145
01:51:57,740 --> 01:51:59,660
Proposing before the dating

3146
01:51:59,660 --> 01:52:01,160
could only scare off the girl!

3147
01:52:01,450 --> 01:52:03,750
I mean if that girl is not me.

3148
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:05,080
Sorry.

3149
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:07,670
Please let me do it again.

3150
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:09,670
Yotsuba?

3151
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:11,630
I remembered my dream

3152
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:13,800
as a child.

3153
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:16,680
It's something everyone longs for.

3154
01:52:16,970 --> 01:52:18,180
An ordinary dream.

3155
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:21,810
To be a bride.

3156
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:29,190
Uesugi,

3157
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:30,770
promise me.

3158
01:52:31,690 --> 01:52:32,900
Someday,

3159
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:35,490
please realize my dream.

3160
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:07,140
A...Actually, to you all...

3161
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:09,350
To you all,

3162
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:11,350
I have to say something.

3163
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:13,980
About the college I'm going to enter,

3164
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:15,900
though I kept silent about it,

3165
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,240
it's in Tokyo!

3166
01:53:18,610 --> 01:53:21,160
Eh? We have known that.

3167
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:21,910
Huh?

3168
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:25,040
We didn't ask about it intentionally.

3169
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,500
But we guess you would do so.

3170
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:28,580
That's right.

3171
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:30,830
We don't mind it at all.

3172
01:53:31,290 --> 01:53:32,960
Ah, really...

3173
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,710
Try your best at the exam.

3174
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:38,170
We can go to see you any time.

3175
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:40,340
Thank you.

3176
01:53:40,930 --> 01:53:42,680
I'm glad to meet you.

3177
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:44,470
See you.

3178
01:53:46,470 --> 01:53:48,430
See you tomorrow.

3179
01:53:54,190 --> 01:53:56,110

3182
01:53:59,150 --> 01:54:00,780
maybe also a little happy.

Being able to see

3184
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:04,820
such a face of Uesugi,

3185
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:06,540
it's so lucky.

3186
01:54:07,450 --> 01:54:08,290
Idiot!

3187
01:54:08,290 --> 01:54:10,330
Didn't we decided not to cry?

3188

Hey, Yotsuba.

3214
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:20,820
You need to live alone
if you enter the college.

3215
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:22,860
Are you really fine with it?

3216

3249
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:32,950
As expected of Americanization,
you got good at jokes.

3250
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:38,040
How about it
when you were in America actually?

3251

3253
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:44,750
It's intonation.

3254
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,300
You are so strict.

3260
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:58,240
for someone who went to
such a pretentious cafe.

3261
01:57:58,310 --> 01:57:59,100
Eh?

3262
01:57:59,350 --> 01:58:01,100

on your Instagram, Ichika.

As a token of thanks,
I will share your store on my Instagram.

please refrain it for now.

a little more try by ourselves.

What?

01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:39,770
I'm proud of you, my sister!

3278
01:58:39,770 --> 01:58:42,190
I won't be embarrassed
to mention you on any occasion.

3279

3288
01:59:04,460 --> 01:59:06,670
I rode a bike here from home.

3289
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:08,340
Rode a bike?

3290
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:09,050
Eh?

But I suppose
Uesugi is coming by metro, right?

3293
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:17,550
Yes. Futarou came back yesterday.

3294
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:19,220
So he's still sleeping...

3295
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:23,730
Eh? What?

3296
01:59:23,730 --> 01:59:26,440
Finally you have to admit it
that you're living together.

3297
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:29,820
Humph, that's why you
started to call secretly from the morning.

3298
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:30,480
Ah!

3299
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:33,150
My make-up artist might come to help.

3300
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:35,070
Are we really going to do that?

3301
01:59:35,070 --> 01:59:37,070
What are you scared of?

3302
01:59:37,070 --> 01:59:39,200
You were excited about it, weren't you?

3303
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:39,950
Right.

3304
01:59:39,950 --> 01:59:42,330
We have to confirm that with Uesugi.

3305
01:59:42,870 --> 01:59:43,750
Ichika.

3306
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,370
I've been wearing it.

3307
01:59:46,790 --> 01:59:49,090
These are our presents for your marriage.

3308
01:59:49,710 --> 01:59:51,840
Mom's keepsake earrings.

3309
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:54,880
Yotsuba, you are prepared, right?

3310
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:57,180
Yes, please.

3311
01:59:58,010 --> 01:59:59,640
Let's get start, girls.

3312
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:01,810
Here we go!

3313
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:04,390
Yotsuba, congratulations on your marriage.

3314
02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:07,480
It hurts!

3315
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:30,250
Groom.

3316
02:00:30,250 --> 02:00:32,880
Here comes a family of the bride.

3317
02:00:33,090 --> 02:00:34,170
Great.

3318
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:36,010
I wondered if you would come.

3319
02:00:36,590 --> 02:00:38,640
Why didn't you show up
during the ceremony?

3320
02:00:39,510 --> 02:00:40,970
Sorry.

3321
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:42,470
Come or not,

3322
02:00:42,470 --> 02:00:44,600
I was considering until just before.

3323
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:46,390
D...Dad!

3324
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:49,020
There's no reason for you to call me dad.

3325
02:00:49,150 --> 02:00:52,070
Thank you sincerely for your coming.

3326
02:00:52,270 --> 02:00:54,480
I'm sorry I was so rude
when I was younger...

3327
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:55,570
Uesugi.

3328
02:00:55,820 --> 02:00:57,570
Let me ask directly.

3329
02:00:57,570 --> 02:00:58,610
Yes.

3330
02:00:59,030 --> 02:01:01,570
Is Yotsuba happy from heart?

3331
02:01:06,370 --> 02:01:07,080
Yes.

3332
02:01:07,870 --> 02:01:08,870
Me too.

3333
02:01:11,130 --> 02:01:12,630
Let's have some wine.

3334
02:01:12,630 --> 02:01:13,040
Eh?

3335
02:01:13,630 --> 02:01:15,960
Ah. Okay. I'll open it for you.

3336
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:17,970
Well.

3337
02:01:18,170 --> 02:01:20,130
Futarou's waiting room is...

3338
02:01:20,590 --> 02:01:21,720
My mom died

3339
02:01:22,010 --> 02:01:24,140
more than 10 years ago.

3340
02:01:24,510 --> 02:01:25,810
The accident happened

3341
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:29,350
right after the opening of her own restaurant,
which was my mother's dream.

3342
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:31,480
Only a large amount of debt borrowed

3343
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:34,360
for opening funds was left in my home.

3344
02:01:35,070 --> 02:01:37,860
My dad lent that vacant store to Nino and Miku.

3345
02:01:38,490 --> 02:01:40,320
One reason is to help them,

3346
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:41,950
and maybe the other

3347
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:44,870
is to entrust them with mom's dream.

3348
02:01:45,660 --> 02:01:47,870
Love a woman with the whole life.

3349
02:01:48,910 --> 02:01:50,710
I want to become such a man.

3350
02:01:51,420 --> 02:01:52,880
Just like my two dads.

3351
02:01:54,750 --> 02:01:55,880
Stop it.

3352
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:57,670
Sorry.

3353
02:01:59,550 --> 02:02:00,970
I'm not use to it.

3354
02:02:01,220 --> 02:02:03,220
Something as being called dad.

3355
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:05,390
Groom.

3356
02:02:05,390 --> 02:02:07,270
The bride wants to see you.

3357
02:02:07,270 --> 02:02:08,270
Please come with me.

3358
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:09,730
Well...

3359
02:02:09,730 --> 02:02:10,810
Go ahead.

3360
02:02:23,570 --> 02:02:24,820
Maruo.

3361
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:26,740
We are also elders now.

3362
02:02:27,370 --> 02:02:30,410
We can only drink some wine
for congratulations?

3363
02:02:32,250 --> 02:02:33,210
Yes...

3364
02:02:33,670 --> 02:02:35,130
That's why I'm drinking.

3365
02:02:37,380 --> 02:02:39,550
Do you think it will go well for them?

3366
02:02:40,090 --> 02:02:41,170
Such a thing

3367
02:02:41,170 --> 02:02:43,680
is not something can be decided as a parent.

3368
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:45,300
But,

3369
02:02:45,550 --> 02:02:47,930
I'm sure it won't be that straightforward.

3370
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:50,020
Anyhow, his opponents

3371
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:52,020
are my daughters.

3372
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:03,150
Futarou, it's the last quintuplets game.

3373
02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:04,990
If there's love,

3374
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:06,700
you can distinguish us.

3375
02:03:11,250 --> 02:03:14,210
Dear guests, excuse me for interrupting you
when you are so busy.

3376
02:03:14,210 --> 02:03:17,210
Thank you for coming to

3377
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:18,960
our wedding reception today.

3378
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:21,260
Quintuplets game...

3379
02:03:23,550 --> 02:03:26,050
Are you idiots!?
The other four except Yotsuba!

3380
02:03:26,050 --> 02:03:28,930
Don't wear a wedding dress for fun!

3381
02:03:28,930 --> 02:03:30,890
Do you know what you are doing?

3382
02:03:31,180 --> 02:03:33,680
It's really a little difficult.

3383
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:35,650
I came up with it.

3384
02:03:35,650 --> 02:03:37,940
And it's not for fun.

3385
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:38,480
Eh?

3386
02:03:38,860 --> 02:03:41,440
Because we are relatives of the bride.

3387
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:43,820
Kidding.

3388
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:45,820
I am the bride myself.

3389
02:03:45,820 --> 02:03:47,820
No, I am.

3390
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:49,490
It's me the bride!

3391
02:03:49,490 --> 02:03:51,700
Futarou, you should know.

3392
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:53,370
Come on, you fool.

3393
02:03:53,790 --> 02:03:56,870
Just when I think
that you've become sensible adults,

3394
02:03:57,170 --> 02:03:59,420
I feel relieved
that you have never changed.

3395
02:03:59,710 --> 02:04:00,840
Don't take me for a fool.

3396
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:02,590
It's you.

3397
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:05,220
Thanks again to my families.

3398
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:07,590
Thanks to

3399
02:04:07,590 --> 02:04:08,930
my dad, mom,

3400
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:11,760
and my sisters, I can be who I am now.

3401
02:04:12,430 --> 02:04:14,600
I'm glad that

3402
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:15,980
you can be my dad.

3403
02:04:18,150 --> 02:04:19,440
You are Ichika.

3404
02:04:20,860 --> 02:04:22,280
The first daughter Ichika,

3405
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:24,110
is an older sister who brings together

3406
02:04:24,110 --> 02:04:25,820
a bunch of girls with different personalities.

3407
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:29,200
As you all know, she's a very popular actress

3408
02:04:29,530 --> 02:04:32,030
and an existence I've been looking up to.

3409
02:04:32,030 --> 02:04:33,290
What?

3410
02:04:33,410 --> 02:04:35,200
I'm so surprised.

3411
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,830
I missed it.

3412
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:39,080
I was bothered by you so much.

3413
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:41,790
Isn't the whole world calling you as cool beauty?

3414
02:04:42,250 --> 02:04:43,670
You can't deceive me.

3415
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:46,220
Sluttish! Crass! Idle your time away!

3416
02:04:46,470 --> 02:04:47,340
Lazy!

3417
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:49,550
You don't need to say that much...

3418
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:50,680
Even though...

3419
02:04:51,180 --> 02:04:52,970
The figure trying to be strong

3420
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:54,850
looked dazzling to me.

3421
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:57,390
You're the great eldest daughter.

3422
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:01,730
The next is you.

3423
02:05:02,570 --> 02:05:03,320
Nino.

3424
02:05:04,280 --> 02:05:07,200
The second daughter Nino,
is a little irritable.

3425
02:05:07,450 --> 02:05:08,860
But she's strong and strict.

3426
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:11,570
She's a elder sister who can always
push our back forward.

3427
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:13,700
She's got outstanding girl power,

3428
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:16,120
that I also have to emulate.

3429
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:18,210
Yes, correct.

3430
02:05:18,210 --> 02:05:20,710
Yea, yea. Good for you.

3431
02:05:23,210 --> 02:05:24,920
Why at such a time...

3432
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:27,090
You could have just pointed out Yotsuba...

3433
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:29,090
Your toughness

3434
02:05:29,470 --> 02:05:31,680
comes from the fact that
you're quite fragile more than others.

3435
02:05:32,260 --> 02:05:33,050
As well as your strictness.

3436
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:35,680
I wonder if it's because
you have that much love.

3437
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:37,520
At that time,

3438
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:40,020
I wasn't able to find out the answer.

3439
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:41,150
Sorry.

3440
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:43,270
It's fine.

3441
02:05:45,820 --> 02:05:47,570
I don't regret.

3442
02:05:48,950 --> 02:05:49,740
Really?

3443
02:05:54,490 --> 02:05:55,450
You are Miku.

3444
02:05:55,870 --> 02:05:56,450
Yes.

3445
02:05:57,290 --> 02:05:58,790
The third daughter Miku

3446
02:05:58,790 --> 02:06:01,710
doesn't feel like an elder sister unexpectedly.

3447
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:03,500
She may be more likely as a close friend

3448
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:05,460
who has been in the same position.

3449
02:06:06,050 --> 02:06:07,130
So, of course,

3450
02:06:07,130 --> 02:06:10,260
I respect Miku who has realized
her own dream.

3451
02:06:14,430 --> 02:06:16,180
I'm sometimes anxious.

3452
02:06:16,180 --> 02:06:18,600
Can I do it well?

3453
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:20,690
Needless to answer.

3454
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:24,190
You've always been struggling with
yourself like that.

3455
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:26,360
Such victory of your inner battle

3456
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:28,230
is no doubt credited to yourself.

3457
02:06:28,690 --> 02:06:29,940
Believe in yourself.

3458
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:32,110
You have always been capable since before.

3459
02:06:33,030 --> 02:06:35,120
I expected you to say that.

3460
02:06:35,490 --> 02:06:37,330
Thank you, Futarou.

3461
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,910
Then only you left, Itsuki.

3462
02:06:41,330 --> 02:06:41,870
Eh?

3463
02:06:43,330 --> 02:06:45,500
I am Yotsuba...

3464
02:06:47,670 --> 02:06:48,880
I'm kidding.

3465
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:51,760
Ta-dah! I'm Itsuki.

3466
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:53,840
How about it? I've been better at it, right?

3467
02:06:54,390 --> 02:06:58,890
Itsuki is my only younger sister
who is so cute.

3468
02:06:59,310 --> 02:07:02,890
Actually she has been
much better than me all the time.

3469
02:07:03,270 --> 02:07:05,690
When I am confused about what to do,

3470
02:07:06,020 --> 02:07:08,360
it's also Itsuki who pushed my back forward.

3471
02:07:08,940 --> 02:07:10,280
This is...

3472
02:07:10,280 --> 02:07:11,740
I can't barely hold it.

3473
02:07:11,940 --> 02:07:14,070
At such a moment, I must tell you.

3474
02:07:14,070 --> 02:07:15,570
After meeting you!

3475
02:07:15,570 --> 02:07:17,570
My life started to go crazy!

3476
02:07:17,870 --> 02:07:20,450
Source of evil! Curry-eating glutton girl!

3477
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:23,120
It's the same with me!

3478
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:25,540
Before I met you,
I couldn't imagine a person

3479
02:07:25,540 --> 02:07:27,790
with no delicacy like you!

3480
02:07:28,210 --> 02:07:30,380
Big-headed! Natural kiss demon!

3481
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:34,300
I really can't get along with you
for my whole life!

3482
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:36,890
Itsuki returned to the former tone she talked.

3483
02:07:36,890 --> 02:07:38,260
It can't be helped.

3484
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:40,350
The opponent is Futarou.

3485
02:07:40,350 --> 02:07:42,770
I've been striving to live in my own way.

3486
02:07:49,730 --> 02:07:51,110
And you are

3487
02:07:52,150 --> 02:07:53,070
Yotsuba.

3488
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:03,700
Yes. That's correct.

3489
02:08:08,710 --> 02:08:11,130
Without my sisters,

3490
02:08:11,130 --> 02:08:14,340
my life will be completely different.

3491
02:08:15,970 --> 02:08:19,100
As one of the quintuplets,
sometimes I felt beholden.

3492
02:08:19,470 --> 02:08:20,760
But I also remember the fun
I share with my sisters

3493
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:23,970
that is hundreds of times
more than the burden.

3494
02:08:27,980 --> 02:08:31,070
I've been staying with you for so long,
I can remember even if I don't like it.

3495
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:33,190
Although I was your tutor,

3496
02:08:33,190 --> 02:08:35,610
it's you who have taught me a lot.

3497
02:08:36,610 --> 02:08:38,910
Being able to meet you quintuplets,

3498
02:08:38,910 --> 02:08:40,990
is one of the few things I'm proud of.

3499
02:08:41,490 --> 02:08:43,950
I feel it so happy being able

3500
02:08:43,950 --> 02:08:45,540
to be one of the quintuplets

3501
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:46,620
and grow up with you girls.

3502
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:49,130
We are a little different
from the other families.

3503
02:08:49,130 --> 02:08:51,750
It may be strange from others' perspective.

3504
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:54,710
I love such a family so much!

3505
02:09:02,220 --> 02:09:03,470
Five years...

3506
02:09:03,850 --> 02:09:05,810
I guess for now everything
could settle down.

3507
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:08,140
My tension finally went away

3508
02:09:08,140 --> 02:09:10,060
and feel exhausted all of a sudden.

3509
02:09:10,310 --> 02:09:12,770
It turns out you also felt nervous.

3510
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:16,030
Although not as much as you, Futarou.

3511
02:09:16,280 --> 02:09:18,860
Your hands were shaking
during the kiss of oath.

3512
02:09:18,860 --> 02:09:20,910
It can't be helped!

3513
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:22,780
Everyone was watching.

3514
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:24,030
With you...

3515
02:09:24,410 --> 02:09:26,450
It reminded me of
what happened 5 years ago...

3516
02:09:32,290 --> 02:09:33,840
After all, that is...

3517
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:35,670
Bride.

3518
02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:38,510
You lost something in the waiting room.

3519
02:09:38,510 --> 02:09:41,550
Oh, thank you!

3520
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:44,680
Sorry.

3521
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:47,180
I don't need it anymore.

3522
02:09:47,730 --> 02:09:49,190
Please discard it for me.

3523
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:49,810
Huh?

3524
02:09:49,810 --> 02:09:51,350
Okay.

3525
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:52,770
Is it okay?

3526
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:54,270
Isn't it your trademark?

3527
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:55,400
It's fine.

3528
02:09:56,030 --> 02:09:58,690
Each of you is special.

3529
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:02,030
No matter how exactly we look...

3530
02:10:02,570 --> 02:10:04,990
There's always someone
who can figure me out.

3531
02:10:14,380 --> 02:10:16,000
What are you doing?

3532
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:17,590
Well done.

3533
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:19,130
It's a good ceremony.

3534
02:10:19,130 --> 02:10:21,090
You ask what are we doing?

3535
02:10:21,090 --> 02:10:23,390
There's only one thing to do
after the ceremony.

3536
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:25,100
The honeymoon!

3537
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:26,810
Huh? Wait...

3538
02:10:26,930 --> 02:10:28,270
Do you all want to go with us?

3539
02:10:28,270 --> 02:10:29,310
(Egypt Guidebook)
Of course.

3540
02:10:29,310 --> 02:10:31,480
(Egypt Guidebook)
We are undecided about the destination.

3541
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:33,310
You really have a strong personality.

3542
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:36,980
It's much happier with all together.

3543
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:37,820
Right?

3544
02:10:37,820 --> 02:10:39,400
Yes, yes!

3545
02:10:39,820 --> 02:10:42,360
If so, point out where you want to go.

3546
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:44,570
As Yotsuba said so...

3547
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:48,040
I feel like we disputed about
the same thing before.

3548
02:10:48,040 --> 02:10:49,950
Oh, in high school!

3549
02:10:49,950 --> 02:10:51,250
Let's get started.

3550
02:10:51,250 --> 02:10:52,670
Here we go!

3551
02:10:57,340 --> 02:10:58,840
Uesugi, get up.

3552
02:11:03,470 --> 02:11:04,890
Good morning.

3553
02:11:05,260 --> 02:11:08,560
Looking at Futarou,
I also want to have a sleep.

3554
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:09,680
You could catch a cold.

3555
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:12,350
Don't sleep here and get up quickly.

3556
02:11:12,690 --> 02:11:14,060
How about the wedding?

3557
02:11:18,230 --> 02:11:19,070
What?

3558
02:11:19,070 --> 02:11:20,480
That's so hasty.

3559
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:23,860
Stop being half asleep,

3560
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:25,110
and decide quickly.

3561
02:11:25,110 --> 02:11:25,660
Eh?

3562
02:11:25,860 --> 02:11:26,740
Decide what?

3563
02:11:26,820 --> 02:11:28,120
The graduation trip.

3564
02:11:28,370 --> 02:11:30,700
Isn't it you who proposed it, Futarou?

3565
02:11:32,540 --> 02:11:34,290
I...Is that so...

3566
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:37,170
An...Anyway, let us five point
where we want to go.

3567
02:11:37,420 --> 02:11:38,290
How about me?

3568
02:11:38,630 --> 02:11:40,550
We all know what's gonna happen though.

3569
02:11:40,550 --> 02:11:42,880
I wonder if I should quit...

3570
02:11:43,090 --> 02:11:44,970
So let's start with"here we go".

3571
02:11:44,970 --> 02:11:45,840
Hey!

3572
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:47,180
Here we go!

3573
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:51,520
I want to see Sakamoto Ryoma.

3574
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:53,980
Isn't it the same spot with the excursion?

3575
02:11:53,980 --> 02:11:55,390
Let's go to Okinawa.

3576
02:11:55,390 --> 02:11:58,520
There are a lot of delicious food in Hokkaido.

3577
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:01,280
There are lots of wonderful destinations.

3578
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:03,860
Girls, let's decide it by rock-paper-scissors!

3579
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:06,240
That's right...

3580
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:08,700
I think it's the same with that time.

3581
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:12,790
Oops...

3582
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:14,790
Completely different.

3583
02:12:20,790 --> 02:12:22,000
How about Futarou?

3584
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:32,770
The quintuplets are so annoying.
